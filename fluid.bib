  abstract  = {A mathematical model for a bubbling fluidized bed has been developed
	to simulate the performance of the fuel-reactor in chemical-looping
	combustion (CLC) systems. This model considers both the fluid dynamic
	of the fluidized bed and freeboard and the kinetics of reduction
	of the oxygen-carrier, here CuO impregnated on alumina. The main
	outputs of the model are the conversion of the carrier and the gas
	composition at the reactor exit, the axial profiles of gas concentrations
	and the fluid dynamical structure of the reactor. The model was validated
	using measurements when burning CH4 in a 10kWth prototype using a
	Cu-based oxygen-carrier. The influence of the circulation rate of
	solids, the load of fuel gas, the reactor temperature and size of
	the oxygen-carrier particles were analyzed. Combustion efficiencies
	predicted by the model showed a good agreement with measurements.
	Having validated the model, the implications for designing and optimizing
	a fuel-reactor were as follows. The inventory of solids for a high
	conversion of the fuel was sensitive to the reactor’s temperature,
	the solids’ circulation rate and the extent to which the solids entering
	to the reactor had been regenerated. The optimal ratio of oxygen-carrier
	to fuel was found to be 1.7-4 for the Cu-based oxygen-carrier used
	here. In this range, the inventory of solids to obtain a combustion
	efficiency of 99.9% at 1073K was less than 130kg/MWth. In addition,
	the model’s results were very sensitive to the resistance to gas
	diffusing between the emulsion and bubble phases in the bed, to the
	decay of solids’ concentration in the freeboard and to the efficiency
	contact between gas and solids in the freeboard. Thus, a simplified
	model, ignoring any restriction to gas and solids contacting each
	other, will under-predict the inventory of solids by a factor of
	2-10.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an immersed boundary method (IBM) to model the
	behaviour of solid-fluid interfaces in incompressible flows on non-conforming,
	unstructured meshes. Based on a smooth-interface direct forcing formulation,
	the proposed forcing method directly and implicitly uses the discretised
	momentum equations to evaluate the source terms required to enforce
	a no-slip condition on the boundary. The IBM is derived for a finite-volume
	framework with an implicit pressure-velocity coupling and a colocated
	variable arrangement, to enable application in complex domains. The
	novel framework is applied to flows with stationary and moving IBs
	on both Cartesian and tetrahedral meshes, and the results are compared
	to and validated with findings reported in the literature. The results
	demonstrate that the proposed formulation results in an accurate
	enforcement of the no-slip condition on the IB at every time-step,
	even for flows with strong transient behaviour and high velocity
	and pressure gradients. The results are similar to or better than
	those obtained with other methods that can only be applied on Cartesian
	meshes. The current method is shown to accurately preserve local
	continuity in the vicinity of the IB, ensuring local and global mass
	conservation in addition to satisfying the local no-slip condition.
	Moreover, the proposed forcing framework shows good results for unstructured
	meshes, with a similar accuracy as obtained on Cartesian meshes.},

  abstract  = {The immersed boundary method (IBM) is a well-suited tool for the direct
	numerical simulation of flows with dense particle suspensions, which
	feature strong and complex flow-particle and particle-particle interactions.
	With the aim to model such flows, this paper proposes to extend the
	Regularised Discrete Momentum Forcing (RDMF-) IBM of Abdol Azis et
	al. (2018) to immersed boundaries (IBs) whose motion is coupled to
	the flow. A modification to the direct-forcing formulation, resulting
	in an offset of the imposed no-slip boundary from a moving immersed
	boundary, is proposed. This offset is exploited in an iterative strong
	flow-particle coupling scheme, where the boundary forces are applied
	at the location of the IB known from the previous time level, while
	correctly enforcing the no-slip condition at the new location of
	the IB. This avoids having to reconstruct the interpolation and spreading
	stencils for every linear iteration of the flow-particle coupling,
	therefore reducing the computational load of the method. A technique
	to ensure the stable modelling of flows involving light particles
	is also presented and is shown to stably cope with a wide range of
	particle-fluid density ratios. The framework is validated by comparing
	the results of the simulation of a single sedimenting sphere with
	published experimental results. Simulations of the fluidisation of
	heavy rigid particles, as well as of the ascent of closely packed
	light particles, are also presented. Use of the radius retraction
	procedure, to compensate for the diffuse representation of the smooth-interface
	IBM, is demonstrated to consistently yield significant improvements
	for moving IB cases with low to intermediate Reynolds numbers. The
	present framework shows good stability properties for a wide range
	of flow regimes with concentrated particle suspensions.},

  abstract  = {Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) has arisen during last years as
	a very promising combustion technology for power plants and industrial
	applications, with inherent CO2 capture which reduces the energy
	penalty imposed on other competing technologies. The use of solid
	fuels in CLC has been highly developed in the last decade and currently
	stands at a technical readiness level (TRL) of 6. In this paper,
	experience gained during CLC operation in continuous units is reviewed
	and appraised, focusing mainly on technical and environmental issues
	relating to the use of solid fuels. Up to now, more than 2700 h of
	operational experience has been reported in 19 pilot plants ranging
	from 0.5 kWth to 4 MWth. When designing a CLC unit of solid fuels,
	the preferred configuration for the scale-up is a two circulating
	fluidized beds (CFB) system. Coal has been the most commonly used
	solid fuel in CLC, but biomass has recently emerged as a very promising
	option to achieve negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon
	dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). Mostly low cost iron and manganese
	materials have been used as oxygen carriers in the so called in-situ
	gasification CLC (iG-CLC). The development of Chemical Looping with
	Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) makes a qualitative step forward in the
	solid fuel combustion, due to the use of materials able to release
	oxygen. The performance and environmental issues of CLC of solid
	fuels is evaluated here. Regarding environmental aspects, the pollutant
	emissions (SO2, NOx, etc.) released into the atmosphere from the
	air reactor are no cause of concern for the environment. However,
	the presence of SO2, NOx and Hg at the exit of the fuel reactor affects
	CO2 quality, which must be taken into account during the later compression
	and purification stages. The effect of the main variables affecting
	CLC performance is evaluated for fuel conversion, CO2 capture rate,
	and combustion efficiency obtained in different CLC units. Solid
	fuel conversion is normally not complete during operation, due to
	the undesired loss of char. A methodology is presented to extrapolate
	the current information to what could be expected in a larger CLC
	system. CO2 capture near 100% has been reported using a highly efficient
	carbon stripper, highly reactive fuels (such as lignites and biomass,
	etc.) or by the CLOU process. Operational experience in iG-CLC has
	showed that it is not possible to reach complete fuel combustion,
	making an additional oxygen polishing step necessary. For the further
	scale-up, it is essential to reduce the unburnt compounds at the
	fuel reactor outlet. Proposals to achieve this reduction already
	exist and include both improvement to the gas-oxygen carrier contact,
	or new design concepts based on the current scheme for iG-CLC. In
	addition, CLOU based on copper materials has shown that complete
	fuel combustion could be achieved. Main challenges for the future
	development and scale-up of CLC technology have been also identified.
	A breakthrough in the future development of CLC technology for solid
	fuels will come from developing long-life materials for CLOU that
	are easy to recover from the ash purge stream.},

	emission in the atmosphere. The norms to restrain these emissions
	have created a need of accurate soot models for piston engine emissions
	prediction in the automotive industry. This article addresses this
	question by coupling a sectional soot model with a tabulated combustion
	model for Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes simulations of the engine
	combustion network Spray A, a high-pressure Dodecane spray with conditions
	very similar to diesel engine sprays. The sectional soot model, which
	has already been used in diesel engines Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes
	simulations with a simpler combustion model, is implemented in the
	IFP-C3D Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes computational fluid dynamics
	code. At each time and location, transport equations are solved for
	several soot sections, including source terms for collisional and
	chemical processes. The soot model is here coupled to the approximated
	diffusion flame ? presumed conditional moment model, which is a tabulated
	combustion model. It allows to represent the minor species required
	by the soot model with a much lower computational cost than a kinetic
	solver and includes complex turbulence?chemistry interactions. The
	predictions of these models agree with the experimental measurements
	for most of the Spray A cases for flame structure and soot production.
	These results show that detailed soot models can be coupled to tabulated
	combustion models with good results in turbulent flames.},

	capabilities, particularly with regard to combustion intermediates

	scattering, and laser-induced fluorescence, simultaneous measurements
	of CO, OH, H2, and NO are obtained along with the major species,
	temperature, and mixture fraction in a series of six piloted methane/air
	jet flames. Flame conditions vary from laminar to turbulent with
	significant localized extinction. Two-photon laser-induced fluorescence
	(TPLIF) is used to determine instantaneous CO concentrations, providing
	an improvement over Raman scattering measurements of CO in methane
	flames. Conditional probability density functions (cpdf's) of species
	mass fractions in the six flames are compared. Significant changes
	are observed in the mass fraction cpdf's of several species. Results
	for H2O, CO2, H2, and OH are consistent with the concept that turbulent
	transport becomes dominant over molecular diffusion within the range
	of Reynolds numbers and axial locations considered in these experiments.
	The cpdf's of CO mass fraction are broadened in the turbulent flames
	relative to the laminar flame. However, there is not an increase
	in the maximum conditional mean value of the CO mass fraction as
	suggested by some previously reported measurements in methane flames.
	The cpdf's of NO mass fraction at a given streamwise location in

	The emphasis is on features of the data that reveal the relative

	flames. The complete series A-F is considered. This includes laminar,
	transitional, and turbulent flames spanning a range in Reynolds number
	from 1100 to 44,800. Results on conditional means of species mass
	fractions, the differential diffusion parameter, and the state of
	the water-gas shift reaction all show that there is an evolution
	in these flames from a scalar structure dominated by molecular diffusion
	to one dominated by turbulent transport. Long records of 6000 single-point
	samples at each of several selected locations in flame D are used
	to quantify the cross-stream (radial) dependence of conditional statistics
	of measured scalars. The cross-stream dependence of the conditional
	scalar dissipation is determined from 6000-shot, line-imaging measurements
	at selected locations. The cross-stream dependence of reactive scalars,
	which is most significant in the near field of the jet flame, is
	attributed to radial differences in both convective and local time
	scales of the flow. Results illustrate some potential limitations
	of common modeling assumptions when applied to laboratory-scale flames

	Two of the major phenomena that differentiate aluminum combustion
	from hydrocarbon-droplet combustion, namely, condensation of the
	aluminum-oxide product and subsequent deposition of part of the condensed
	oxide onto the particle, are accounted for in detail with a submodel
	for each phenomenon. The effect of the oxide cap in the distortion

	two-dimensional species and temperature profiles, are analyzed and

	to approach a diffusion-controlled process for the oxidizers (O2,
	CO2, and H2O) and conditions treated. The flame-zone location and
	thickness are found to vary with the oxidizer. The result shows that
	the exponent of the particle-diameter dependence of the burning time
	is not a constant and changes from ≈1.2 for smaller-diameter particles
	to ≈1.9 for larger-diameter particles. Owing to deposition of the

  abstract  = {Metal fuels, as recyclable carriers of clean energy, are promising
	alternatives to fossil fuels in a future low-carbon economy. Fossil
	fuels are a convenient and widely-available source of stored solar
	energy that have enabled our modern society; however, fossil-fuel
	production cannot perpetually keep up with increasing energy demand,
	while carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel combustion cause
	climate change. Low-carbon energy carriers, with high energy density,
	are needed to replace the multiple indispensable roles of fossil
	fuels, including for electrical and thermal power generation, for
	powering transportation fleets, and for global energy trade. Metals
	have high energy densities and metals are, therefore, fuels within
	many batteries, energetic materials, and propellants. Metal fuels
	can be burned with air or reacted with water to release their chemical
	energy at a range of power-generation scales. The metal-oxide combustion
	products are solids that can be captured and then be recycled using
	zero-carbon electrolysis processes powered by clean energy, enabling
	metals to be used as recyclable zero-carbon solar fuels or electrofuels.
	A key technological barrier to the increased use of metal fuels is
	the current lack of clean and efficient combustor/reactor/engine
	technologies to convert the chemical energy in metal fuels into motive
	or electrical power (energy). This paper overviews the concept of
	low-carbon metal fuels and summarizes the current state of our knowledge
	regarding the reaction of metal fuels with water, to produce hot
	hydrogen on demand, and the combustion of metal fuels with air in
	laminar and turbulent flames. Many important questions regarding
	metal-fuel combustion processes remain unanswered, as do questions
	concerning the energy-cycle efficiency and life-cycle environmental
	impacts and economics of metals as recyclable fuels. Metal fuels
	can be an important technology option within a future low-carbon
	society and deserve focused attention to address these open questions.},

  abstract  = {It is becoming widely recognized that our society must transition
	to low-carbon energy systems to combat global climate change, and
	renewable energy sources are needed to provide energy security in
	a world with limited fossil-fuel resources. While many clean power-generation
	solutions have been proposed and are being developed, our ability
	to transition to a low-carbon society is prevented by the present
	lack of clean and renewable energy carriers that can replace the
	crucial roles that fossil fuels play, due to their abundance, convenience
	and performance, in global energy trade and transportation. Any future
	low-carbon energy carriers that aim to displace or supplement fossil
	fuels must have high energy densities for convenient trade and storage,
	and should be consumable within efficient high-power-density engines
	for transportation, heavy machinery, and other off-grid energy applications.
	Hydrogen and batteries have been widely studied but they are not
	suitable for use as international energy-trading commodities and
	they cannot provide the energy density and safety demanded by society.
	Metal fuels, produced using low-carbon recycling systems powered
	by clean primary energy, such as solar and wind, promise energy densities
	that are competitive to fossil fuels with low, or even negative,
	net carbon dioxide emissions. To date, however, few practical high-power-density
	end-use devices for generating heat or power from metal fuels have
	been proposed. This paper proposes a novel concept for power generation
	in which metal fuels are burned with air in a combustor to provide
	clean, high-grade heat. The metal-fuel combustion heat can be used
	directly for industrial or residential heating and can also power
	external-combustion engines, operating on the Rankine or Stirling
	cycles, or thermo-electric generators over a wide range of power
	levels. A design concept is proposed for a metal-fuelled combustor
	that is based upon extensive experimental and theoretical studies
	of stabilized and propagating metal flames performed at McGill University.
	This paper also reviews the fundamental and applied aspects of metal-fuel
	combustion in order to provide the framework needed to assess any
	potential metal engine technologies. The energy and power densities
	of the proposed metal-fuelled zero-carbon heat engines are predicted
	to be close to current fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines,
	making them an attractive technology for a future low-carbon society.},

  abstract = {The fundamental combustion and emissions properties of advanced biofuels
	are reviewed, and their impact on engine performance is discussed,
	in order to guide the selection of optimal conversion routes for
	obtaining desired fuel combustion properties. Advanced biofuels from
	second- and third-generation feedstocks can result in significantly
	reduced life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions, compared to traditional
	fossil fuels or first-generation biofuels from food-based feedstocks.
	These advanced biofuels include alcohols, biodiesel, or synthetic
	hydrocarbons obtained either from hydrotreatment of oxygenated biofuels
	or from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The engine performance and exhaust
	pollutant emissions of advanced biofuels are linked to their fundamental
	combustion properties, which can be modeled using combustion chemical-kinetic
	mechanisms and surrogate fuel blends. In general, first-generation
	or advanced biofuels perform well in existing combustion engines,
	either as blend additives with petro-fuels or as pure “drop-in” replacements.
	Generally, oxygenated biofuels produce lower intrinsic nitric-oxide
	and soot emissions than hydrocarbon fuels in fundamental experiments,
	but engine-test results can be complicated by multiple factors. In
	order to reduce engine emissions and improve fuel efficiency, several
	novel technologies, including engines and fuel cells, are being developed.
	The future fuel requirements for a selection of such novel power-generation
	technologies, along with their potential performance improvements
	over existing technologies, are discussed. The trend in the biofuels
	and transportation industries appears to be moving towards drop-in
	fuels that require little changes in vehicle or fueling infrastructure,
	but this comes at a cost of reduced life-cycle efficiencies for the
	overall alternative-fuel production and utilization system. In the
	future, fuel-flexible, high-efficiency, and ultra-low-emissions heat-engine
	and fuel-cell technologies promise to enable consumers to switch
	to the lowest-cost and cleanest fuel available in their market at
	any given time. This would also enable society as a whole to maximize
	its global level of transportation activity, while maintaining urban
	air quality, within an energy- and carbon-constrained world.},

	particle size as the mode of burning transitions from diffusion to
	kinetically controlled. To better understand the rate dependent diffusion
	and kinetic processes, a fully compressible, one-dimensional, spherically
	symmetric particle burn model is developed. Several cases are studied
	to explore the burning of aluminum particles in air, carbon-dioxide
	and steam environments. Predictions of burn rates versus particle
	size reveal significant deviations from a diffusion controlled burning
	limit - highlighting the importance of accounting for finite-rate
	chemistry in modeling the burning of sub-micron aluminum particles.
	While overall agreement to data is satisfactory, the detailed model
	cannot be directly used in system level tools due to computational
	cost. Two reduced modeling strategies are therefore explored to account
	for finite-rate chemistry effects in simpler models for use in system
	level CFD analysis. The first is an augmented D2-law where the finite-rate
	chemistry is treated as a perturbation to flame sheet approximation
	via augmented burn rate “constants”. Predictions using this approach
	of deflagration speeds in dusty aluminum-air gases agree well with
	experiments and show evidence of a maximum flame speed for a given

  abstract  = {Abstract Sliding droplets are crucial in many industrial applications.
	Examples are coating and separation processes involving multiple
	phases and liquid films. Often one can observe how a sliding droplet
	halts midstream on a solid surface. Wetting defects such as topographic
	structures can lead to a pinning of sliding droplets. In order to
	assess the influence of liquid density and surface tension on the
	pinning, direct numerical simulations are performed. After the model
	and its discretization are introduced, the solution is validated.
	Simulation results of gravity-driven droplets on inclined surfaces
	with structures in the size of the droplets are presented and the
	observed requirements for pinning a sliding droplet to a surface
	are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The existence of different distinct phases during the aluminum combustion
	process was unambiguously proved and widely discussed in several
	studies on single burning aluminum particles. Indeed, in the case
	of a combustion in diffusion vapor phase, the formation of growing
	aluminum oxide caps on the droplet surface is suspected to drive
	the transition from a symmetric to an asymmetric regime. Especially
	based on diverse observations for aluminum particles burning in O2/N2,
	a hypothesis was proposed on the effect of N2 which probably contributes
	to the regime transition occurrence. To extend research efforts and
	get a further understanding of the asymmetric transition development,
	and, more generally on aluminum combustion, an analysis in O2/N2,
	O2/Ar and O2/He oxidizing mixtures is presented. This work is based
	on an advanced experimental technique allowing to levitate a single
	particle and visualize its self-sustained combustion with high temporal
	and spatial resolution. Combustion parameters of ignited micron-sized
	aluminum particles (30-100 µm) at atmospheric pressure were accurately
	determined using optical diagnostics. Results provide a new quantified
	dataset and allow to compare the relative effect of N2, Ar and He
	as diluent gases in the aluminum combustion process. Burning times
	are found to be similar, regardless of the considered diluent gas,
	as well as the aluminum consumption rate in symmetric regime. However,
	estimations on the relative duration of the symmetric phase demonstrate
	a potential influence of N2 which promotes the regime transition
	in comparison with Ar and He for low molar fraction of oxidizer.
	The ratio between flame and droplet diameters is also modified depending
	on the inert gas and is determined. Observed trends are discussed
	and compared to available data to improve the description and quantification
	of the relative influence of the inert gases.},

	to stochastic differential equations. We give a brief survey of the
	area focusing on a number of application areas where approximations
	to strong solutions are important, with a particular focus on computational
	biology applications, and give the necessary analytical tools for
	understanding some of the important concepts associated with stochastic
	processes. We present the stochastic Taylor series expansion as the
	fundamental mechanism for constructing effective numerical methods,
	give general results that relate local and global order of convergence
	and mention the Magnus expansion as a mechanism for designing methods
	that preserve the underlying structure of the problem. We also present
	various classes of explicit and implicit methods for strong solutions,
	based on the underlying structure of the problem. Finally, we discuss
	implementation issues relating to maintaining the Brownian path,
	efficient simulation of stochastic integrals and variable-step-size
	implementations based on various types of control.]},

	Next, the different types of fuel cells and their main components

	engines grow larger, AMR simulations will require algorithms that
	achieve new levels of efficient parallelization and memory management.
	We have attempted to employ new techniques to achieve both of these
	goals. Patch or grid based AMR often employs ghost cells to decouple
	the hyperbolic advances of each grid on a given refinement level.
	This decoupling allows each grid to be advanced independently. In
	AstroBEAR we utilize this independence by threading the grid advances
	on each level with preference going to the finer level grids. This
	allows for global load balancing instead of level by level load balancing
	and allows for greater parallelization across both physical space
	and AMR level. Threading of level advances can also improve performance
	by interleaving communication with computation, especially in deep
	simulations with many levels of refinement. While we see improvements
	of up to 30% on deep simulations run on a few cores, the speedup
	is typically more modest (5-20%) for larger scale simulations. To
	improve memory management we have employed a distributed tree algorithm
	that requires processors to only store and communicate local sections
	of the AMR tree structure with neighboring processors. Using this
	distributed approach we are able to get reasonable scaling efficiency
	(>80%) out to 12288 cores and up to 8 levels of AMR - independent
	of the use of threading.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an efficient ghost-cell immersed boundary method
	for incompressible flow simulations. The method employs a locally
	directional extrapolation scheme along all discretization directions
	for the ghost values. Additionally, it involves fictitious discrete
	boundary forcing terms instead of the ghost values in the governing
	equations. In this way, the boundary is represented more accurately
	than in prior IBMs and it is possible to fulfill the divergence-free
	condition. When combined with high-order spatial discretization schemes,
	the IBM order is reduced locally near the immersed boundary in a
	step-wise manner. In this way, the method delivers more compact stencils
	and is able to deal with sharp interfaces. By handling the distance
	from the ghost point to the boundary carefully, the proposed method
	delivers lower truncation errors than standard IBM, with clean (persistent)
	convergence rate and enhanced stability. The parallel implementation
	of this approach is straightforward. Its accuracy has been checked
	by considering a variety of test cases, including irregular, three-dimensional,
	and moving boundaries. The local accuracy for the proposed method
	is formally second order, and is measured to be close to this value
	using numerical tests.},

	not satisfactorily predict soot volume fraction, the key engineering
	quantity for most applications. Due to intense energy exchange by
	radiative heat transfer, even basic scalar fields like temperature
	may then be inaccurately described. The objective of the present
	study is to develop enhanced soot prediction models for such flames,
	valid for a wide range of configurations. The emphasis in this work
	is specifically on the particulate phase models and not on gas-phase
	chemistry. The evolution of soot particles is described by models
	accounting for nucleation, surface growth, aggregation and oxidation.
	The Direct Quadrature Method of Moments is employed to solve the
	monovariate Population Balance Equations. The values of four model
	parameters associated with these models and with soot particle radiation
	are first optimized numerically by combining Genetic Algorithms with
	Computational Fluid Dynamics. The objective functions are formulated
	based on the difference between the obtained simulation results and
	recently published experimental measurements of temperature and soot
	volume fraction. After obtaining an optimal parameter set, the resulting
	models are further tested against three independent experimental
	configurations, leading also here to a good agreement and thus demonstrating
	a high level of generality. Nevertheless, a shift in the peak soot
	position toward the burner is systematically observed. This issue
	could be finally solved by refining the description of turbulence/chemistry
	coupling using a flamelet model and adding another optimization parameter.
	The final results are in better agreement with all measured fields
	compared to the previous models and therefore demonstrate that optimization
	based on flow simulations can efficiently support the development

	We also show that unlike many adaptive schemes, no issues arise in

  abstract = {Predictive mechanisms for particle ignition and combustion rates are
	required in order to develop optimized propellant and energetic formulations
	using micron-sized metal powders, such as aluminum. Most current
	descriptions are based on laboratory experiments performed in stationary
	or laminar combustion configurations. However, turbulent environments
	exist in most applications and validity of the present descriptions
	for such environments has not been established. This experimental
	study is aimed to measure burn times for aluminum particles burning
	in environments with different levels of turbulence. A laminar air-acetylene
	flame is produced, and auxiliary tangential jets of air with adjustable
	flow rates are used to achieve different controlled levels of turbulence.
	Fine spherical aluminum powder is injected in the flame axially using
	a flow of nitrogen. The streaks of burning particles are photographed
	using a camera placed behind a mechanical chopper interrupting the
	photo-exposure with a pre-set frequency. The obtained dashed streaks
	are used to measure the particle burn times for different flow conditions.
	The particle burn times are correlated with the particle size distribution
	to obtain the burn time as a function of the particle size. The results
	are processed to obtain a correction for the Al particle burn rate
	as a function of the turbulence intensity, I. The measured burn times
	are longer than predicted for the micron-sized Al particles using
	a correlation based on survey of earlier experiments, mostly with
	coarser Al powders. Increased turbulence intensity results in substantial
	reduction of the particle burn time. Present data suggest that the
	burn rate for particle combustion in a laminar environment should
	be multiplied by 1+18.2I, to estimate the acceleration of aluminum
	combustion in turbulent environments.},

  abstract = {Gas-particle and other dispersed-phase flows can be described by a
	kinetic equation containing terms for spatial transport, acceleration,
	and particle processes (such as evaporation or collisions). In principle,
	the kinetic description is valid from the dilute (non-collisional)
	to the dense limit. However, its numerical solution in multi-dimensional
	systems is intractable due to the large number of independent variables.
	As an alternative, Lagrangian methods “discretize” the density function
	into “parcels” that are simulated using Monte-Carlo methods. While
	quite accurate, as in any statistical approach, Lagrangian methods
	require a relatively large number of parcels to control statistical
	noise, and thus are computationally expensive. A less costly alternative
	is to solve Eulerian transport equations for selected moments of
	the kinetic equation. However, it is well known that in the dilute
	limit Eulerian methods have great difficulty to describe correctly
	the moments as predicted by a Lagrangian method. Here a two-node
	quadrature-based Eulerian moment closure is developed and tested
	for the kinetic equation. It is shown that the method can successfully
	handle highly non-equilibrium flows (e.g. impinging particle jets,
	jet crossing, particle rebound off walls, finite Stokes number flows)
	that heretofore could not be treated accurately with the Eulerian
	approach.},

  abstract  = {In data-based control design, system-identification techniques are
	used to extract low-dimensional representations of the input-output
	map between actuators and sensors from observed data signals. Under
	realistic conditions, noise in the signals is present and is expected
	to influence the identified system representation. For the subsequent
	design of the controller, it is important to gauge the sensitivity
	of the system representation to noise in the observed data; this
	information will impact the robustness of the controller and influence
	the stability margins for a closed-loop configuration. Commonly,
	full Monte Carlo analysis has been used to quantify the effect of
	data noise on the system identification and control design, but in
	fluid systems, this approach is often prohibitively expensive, due
	to the high dimensionality of the data input space, for both numerical
	simulations and physical experiments. Instead, we present a framework
	for the estimation of statistical properties of identified system
	representations given an uncertainty in the processed data. Our approach
	consists of a perturbative method, relating noise in the data to
	identified system parameters, which is followed by a Monte Carlo
	technique to propagate uncertainties in the system parameters to
	error bounds in Nyquist and Bode plots. This hybrid approach combines
	accuracy, by treating the system-identification part perturbatively,
	and computational efficiency, by applying Monte Carlo techniques
	to the low-dimensional input space of the control design and performance/stability
	evaluation part. This combination makes the proposed technique affordable
	and efficient even for large-scale flow-control problems. The ARMarkov/LS
	identification procedure has been chosen as a representative system-identification
	technique to illustrate this framework and to obtain error bounds
	on the identified system parameters based on the signal-to-noise
	ratio of the input-output data sequence. The procedure is illustrated
	on the control design for flow over an idealized aerofoil with a
	trailing-edge splitter plate.},

	combustion was also tested. Three distinct stages were identified
	in Al particle combustion, which correspond to different temperatures,

	between the stages were shown to correlate with the internal phase
	transformations occurring in the burning Al droplets. Growing on
	spinning Al particles “oxide caps” were shown to cause rapid changes

  abstract  = {A recently developed chemical kinetic scheme for C2 fuel combustion
	with PAH growth has been implemented in a parallelized coflow flame
	solver. The reaction mechanism has been developed to include almost
	all reasonably well-established reaction classes for aromatic ring
	formation and soot particle precursor molecular weight growth. The
	model has recently been validated for zero- and one-dimensional premixed
	flame systems [N.A. Slavinskaya, P. Frank, Combust. Flame 156 (2009)
	1705-1722] and has now been updated and extended to a sooting ethylene/air
	diffusion flame in the coflow geometry. Updates to the mechanism
	reflect the latest advances in the literature and address numerical
	stiffness that was present in diffusion flame systems. The chemical
	kinetic mechanism has been coupled to a sectional aerosol dynamics
	model for soot growth, considering PAH-based inception and surface
	condensation, surface chemistry (growth and oxidation), coagulation,
	and fragmentation. The sectional model predicts the soot aggregate
	number density and the number of primary particles per aggregate
	in each section, so as to yield information on particle size distribution
	and structure. Flame simulation data for the present mechanism is
	compared to data computed using two other reaction schemes [J. Appel,
	H. Bockhorn, M. Frenklach, Combust. Flame 121 (2000) 122-136; N.M.
	Marinov, W.J. Pitz, C.K. Westbrook, A.M. Vincitore, M.J. Castaldi,
	S.M. Senkan, Combust. Flame 114 (1998) 192-213]. The computed data
	are also compared to numerous experimental data sets. Whereas the
	fuel oxidation chemistry in all three mechanisms are essentially
	the same, the PAH growth pathways vary considerably. It is shown
	that soot concentrations on the wings of the flame (where soot formation
	is dominated by surface chemistry) can be predicted with two of the
	three mechanisms. However, only the present mechanism with its enhanced
	PAH growth routes can also predict the correct order of magnitude
	of soot volume fraction in the low-sooting, inception-dominated,
	central region of the flame. In applying this chemical mechanism,
	the parameter α, which describes the portion of soot surface sites
	that are available for chemical reaction, has been reduced to a theoretically
	acceptable range, thus improving the quality of the model.},

  abstract = {Mitigation of soot emissions from combustion devices is a global concern.
	For example, recent EURO 6 regulations for vehicles have placed stringent
	limits on soot emissions. In order to allow design engineers to achieve
	the goal of reduced soot emissions, they must have the tools to so.
	Due to the complex nature of soot formation, which includes growth
	and oxidation, detailed numerical models are required to gain fundamental
	insights into the mechanisms of soot formation. A detailed description
	of the CoFlame FORTRAN code which models sooting laminar coflow diffusion
	flames is given. The code solves axial and radial velocity, temperature,
	species conservation, and soot aggregate and primary particle number
	density equations. The sectional particle dynamics model includes
	nucleation, PAH condensation and HACA surface growth, surface oxidation,
	coagulation, fragmentation, particle diffusion, and thermophoresis.
	The code utilizes a distributed memory parallelization scheme with
	strip-domain decomposition. The public release of the CoFlame code,
	which has been refined in terms of coding structure, to the research
	community accompanies this paper. CoFlame is validated against experimental
	data for reattachment length in an axi-symmetric pipe with a sudden
	expansion, and ethylene-air and methane-air diffusion flames for
	multiple soot morphological parameters and gas-phase species. Finally,
	the parallel performance and computational costs of the code is investigated.

  abstract  = {The velocity distribution of dilute suspensions of heavy particles
	in gas-solid turbulent flows is investigated. A statistical approach
	- the mesoscopic Eulerian formalism (MEF) - is developed in which
	an average conditioned on a realization of the turbulent carrier
	flow is introduced and enables a decomposition of the instantaneous
	particle velocity into two contributions. The first is a contribution
	from an underlying continuous turbulent velocity field shared by
	all the particles - the mesoscopic Eulerian particle velocity field
	(MEPVF) - that accounts for all particle-particle and fluid-particle
	two-point correlations. The second contribution corresponds to a
	distribution - the quasi-Brownian velocity distribution (QBVD) -
	that represents a random velocity component satisfying the molecular
	chaos assumption that is not spatially correlated and identified
	with each particle of the system. The MEF is used to investigate
	properties of statistically stationary particle-laden isotropic turbulence.
	The carrier flow is computed using direct numerical simulation (DNS)
	or large-eddy simulation (LES) with discrete particle tracking employed
	for the dispersed phase. Particle material densities are much larger
	than that of the fluid and the force of the fluid on the particle
	is assumed to reduce to the drag contribution. Computations are performed
	in the dilute regime for which the influences of inter-particle collisions
	and fluid-turbulence modulation are neglected. The simulations show
	that increases in particle inertia increase the contribution of the
	quasi-Brownian component to the particle velocity. The particle velocity
	field is correlated at larger length scales than the fluid, with
	the integral length scales of the MEPVF also increasing with particle
	inertia. Consistent with the previous work of Abrahamson (1975),
	the MEF shows that in the limiting case of large inertia, particle
	motion becomes stochastically equivalent to a Brownian motion with
	a random spatial distribution of positions and velocities. For the
	current system of statistically stationary isotropic turbulence,
	both the DNS and LES show that the fraction of the kinetic energy
	residing in the mesoscopic field decreases with particle inertia
	as the square root of the ratio of the total particulate-phase kinetic
	energy to that of the fluid.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances concerning analysis of sprays and drop/turbulence
	interactions are reviewed. Consideration is given to dilute sprays
	and related dilute dispersed flows, which contain well-defined dispersed-phase
	elements (e.g. spherical drops) and have dispersed-phase volume fractions
	less than 1%; and to the near-injector, dense spray region, having
	irregularly-shaped liquid elements and relatively-high liquid fractions.
	Early analysis of dilute sprays and other dispersed flows assumed
	either locally-homogeneous flow (LHF), implying infinitely-fast interphase
	transport rates, or deterministic separated flow (DSF) where finite
	interphase transport rates are considered, but interactions between
	dispersed-phase elements and turbulence are ignored. These limits
	are useful in some instances; however, recent evidence shows that
	both methods are deficient for quantitative estimates of the structure
	of most practical dispersed flows, including sprays. As a result,
	stochastic separated flow (SSF) methods have been developed, which
	treat both finite interphase transport rates and dispersed phase
	(drop)/turbulence interactions using random-walk computations for
	the dispersed phase. Evaluation of SSF methods for particle-laden
	jets; nonevaporating, evaporating and combusting sprays; and noncondensing
	and condensing bubbly jets has been encouraging, suggesting capabilities
	of current SSF methods to treat a variety of interphase processes.
	However, current methods are relatively ad hoc and many fundamental
	problems must still be resolved for dilute flows, e.g. effects of
	anisotropic turbulence, modification of continuous-phase turbulence
	properties by the dispersed phase (turbulence modulation), effects
	of turbulence on interphase transport rates, and drop shattering,
	among others. Dense sprays have received less attention and are poorly
	understood due to substantial theoretical and experimental difficulties,
	e.g. the idealization of spherical drops is not realistic, effects
	of liquid breakup and collisions are difficult to describe, spatial
	resolution is limited and the flow is opaque to optical diagnostics
	which have been helpful for studies of dilute sprays. Limited progress
	thus far, however, suggests that LHF analysis may provide a useful
	first-approximation of the structure and mixing properties of dense
	sprays near pressure-atomizing injectors. Since dense-spray processes
	fix initial conditions needed to rationally analyze dilute sprays,
	more research is this area is clearly warranted.},

	Monte Carlo/line-by-line (PMC/LBL) spectral model are exercised to

	characteristics in transient high-pressure turbulent n-dodecane spray
	flames, under conditions that are relevant for compression-ignition

	measurements and with results from a locally well-stirred reactor
	(WSR) model that neglects unresolved turbulent fluctuations in composition
	and temperature. Computed total soot mass and soot spatial distributions
	are highly sensitive to the modeling of unresolved turbulent fluctuations.
	To achieve reasonable agreement between model and experiment and
	to capture the highly intermittent nature of soot in the turbulent
	flame, it is necessary to accurately represent mixing and the low
	diffusivity of soot particles. This is accomplished in the PDF framework
	using a mixing model that enforces locality in the gas-phase composition
	space, while not mixing the transported soot variables. The results
	suggest that mixing is at least as important as kinetics in controlling
	soot formation and evolution in high-pressure turbulent flames. Regarding
	radiation, radiant fractions and global influences of radiation in
	these flames are relatively small. Nevertheless, an examination of
	spectral radiative heat transfer provides valuable insight into the
	nature and modeling of radiation in high-pressure turbulent combustion
	systems. There are complex spectral interactions that are revealed
	using PMC/LBL. CO2 dominates the total radiative emission and reabsorption,
	but most of the emitted CO2 radiation is reabsorbed before reaching
	the walls. On the other hand, most of the emitted soot radiation
	reaches the walls, but soot radiation is a small contribution overall;
	H2O dominates the radiation that reaches the walls. Global turbulence-radiation
	interactions (TRI) effects are small, but radiative emission from
	soot increases by approximately a factor two when TRI are considered.
	Radiative transfer contributes both to energy redistribution in the
	vessel and to wall heat losses. The results suggest that a simple
	model that considers soot radiation and the principal CO2 and H2O
	spectral bands might be sufficient to capture the key influences
	of radiation in engine CFD. It is expected that these findings will
	contribute to the development of truly predictive CFD models for

	velocity field v(x,t) approaches a unique, equilibrium field, independent
	of initial conditions. A precise inequality is derived specifying
	how small τ must be for this to occur. When it does, v(x,t) depends
	only on local fluid quantities (velocity and its spatial and temporal
	derivatives), and may be expressed as an expansion in τ. We derive
	an expansion which generalizes those of previous researchers. The
	first-order truncation of this expansion may be computed efficiently,
	so by using it to approximate v, the method avoids the need to solve
	additional partial differential equations, and therefore is much
	faster than the standard Eulerian method. Results from a direct numerical
	simulation of turbulent channel flow indicate that this first-order
	approximation of v is sufficiently accurate. Static tests performed
	at one time-instance show the actual velocities of particles evolved
	in a Lagrangian fashion are estimated well by evaluating the first-order
	approximation of v at the particles' positions. In particular, turbophoresis
	is represented accurately. Dynamic tests examine the effect of using
	the first-order approximation of v to evolve particles. The distribution
	of particles evolved in this way differs little from that of particles
	evolved using the standard Lagrangian method, indicating that static
	errors do not accumulate over time. In particular, the approximate
	method accurately captures preferential concentration in regions
	of high strain and low vorticity. Analogous results hold for bubbles.
	Therefore, for sufficiently small particles of any density, the first-order
	approximation to v is accurate, so the proposed variant of the Eulerian

  abstract  = {Starting from a kinetic theory (KT) model for monodisperse granular
	flow, the exact Reynolds-averaged (RA) equations are derived for
	the particle phase in a collisional fluid-particle flow. The corresponding
	equations for a constant-density fluid phase are derived from a model
	that includes drag and buoyancy coupling with the particle phase.
	The fully coupled macroscale/hydrodynamic model, rigorously derived
	from a kinetic equation for the particles, is written in terms of
	the particle-phase volume fraction, the particle-phase velocity and
	the granular temperature (or total granular energy). As derived from
	the hydrodynamic model, the RA turbulence model solves for the RA
	particle-phase volume fraction, the phase-averaged (PA) particle-phase
	velocity, the PA granular temperature and the PA turbulent kinetic
	energy of the particle phase. Thus, unlike in most previous derivations
	of macroscale turbulence models for moderately dense granular flows,
	a clear distinction is made between the PA granular temperature $\Theta

  abstract  = {The scope of the present study is Eulerian modeling and simulation
	of polydisperse liquid sprays undergoing droplet coalescence and
	evaporation. The fundamental mathematical description is the Williams
	spray equation governing the joint number density function f(v,u;x,t)
	of droplet volume and velocity. Eulerian multi-fluid models have
	already been rigorously derived from this equation in Laurent et
	al. [F. Laurent, M. Massot, P. Villedieu, Eulerian multi-fluid modeling
	for the numerical simulation of coalescence in polydisperse dense
	liquid sprays, J. Comput. Phys. 194 (2004) 505-543]. The first key
	feature of the paper is the application of direct quadrature method
	of moments (DQMOM) introduced by Marchisio and Fox [D.L. Marchisio,
	R.O. Fox, Solution of population balance equations using the direct
	quadrature method of moments, J. Aerosol Sci. 36 (2005) 43-73] to
	the Williams spray equation. Both the multi-fluid method and DQMOM
	yield systems of Eulerian conservation equations with complicated
	interaction terms representing coalescence. In order to focus on
	the difficulties associated with treating size-dependent coalescence
	and to avoid numerical uncertainty issues associated with two-way
	coupling, only one-way coupling between the droplets and a given
	gas velocity field is considered. In order to validate and compare
	these approaches, the chosen configuration is a self-similar 2D axisymmetrical
	decelerating nozzle with sprays having various size distributions,
	ranging from smooth ones up to Dirac delta functions. The second
	key feature of the paper is a thorough comparison of the two approaches
	for various test-cases to a reference solution obtained through a
	classical stochastic Lagrangian solver. Both Eulerian models prove
	to describe adequately spray coalescence and yield a very interesting
	alternative to the Lagrangian solver. The third key point of the
	study is a detailed description of the limitations associated with
	each method, thus giving criteria for their use as well as for their
	respective efficiency.},

	considered including H2, H2/He, CO/H2/N2, CH4/H2/N2, and partially
	premixed CH4/air. This group of flames represents a range of complexity
	with regard to NO formation and is currently the subject of multiple
	modeling efforts. Measurements of radiant fraction, temperature,
	and NO mass fraction have been compared with previously obtained
	modeling results for the H2, H2/He, and CH4/air flames. The results
	show that an emission-only radiation submodel is adequate for modeling
	the hydrogen flames but not the CH4/air flames. In one CH4/air flame,
	the emission-only computations overpredict the radiant heat loss
	by a factor of 2.5. A comparison of adiabatic and radiative computations
	shows that the inclusion of radiative losses can reduce the predicted
	peak NO levels by as much as 57%. An accurate radiation submodel
	for hydrocarbon flames must account for radiative absorption. Spectrally
	resolved radiation calculations show that absorption by CO2 near
	4.3 μm is primarily responsible for the increased optical density
	of the hydrocarbon flames. The series of turbulent jet flames considered
	here contains a range of CO2 levels and provide a basis for developing
	a realistic radiation model that incorporates absorption by CO2.},

	by gas turbine combustors is currently motivating considerable efforts
	to better understand, model and predict soot formation. This complex
	phenomenon is very difficult to study in detail with experiment,
	and numerical simulation is an essential complementary tool. Considering
	that the chemistry of soot particles strongly depends on their size,
	the numerical prediction of soot formation requires the description
	of their size distribution. To do so, either Eulerian methods (sectional
	or moments), or stochastic Lagrangian approaches are reported in
	the literature. In the present work a far more simple semi-deterministic
	Lagrangian approach is proposed. Combined to the semi-empirical model
	of Leung et al. (1991) for soot chemistry, the Lagrangian approach
	is first validated on a one-dimensional premixed ethylene-air flame.
	The model is then applied to a gaseous non-premixed ethylene-air
	burner measured at DLR and computed with Large Eddy Simulation (LES).
	The gaseous chemistry is described with an Analytically Reduced Chemistry
	(ARC) to guarantee a good prediction of combustion and gaseous soot
	precursors. Results are validated against experiment and compared,
	in terms of accuracy and CPU cost, to an Eulerian semi-empirical
	model. To the authors knowledge, it is the first time that such Lagrangian
	particle tracking approach is used for soot. Results obtained in
	terms of accuracy and computing time are very encouraging.},

  abstract  = {This work addresses the role of heterogeneous reactions occurring
	during aluminum combustion. Direct numerical simulations are conducted
	on a single aluminum burning particle accounting for both detailed
	gas-phase and surface kinetic mechanism. A surface kinetic solver
	has been developed to take into account surface and gas/surface interactions.
	The model is validated against experimental measurements and appears
	to be predictive. Calculations are performed through different pressure
	regimes (1 and 10 bar), atmospheres (O2, CO2, CO and H2O) and droplet
	sizes (from 1 to 400 µm). Flames structures (temperature and AlO
	profile) computed by the model are consistent with experimental measurements
	and observations. The reaction zones for CO and H2O atmospheres are
	computed to be very close to the surface which is an evidence of
	a combustion mostly driven by chemical surface phenomena. In some
	cases surface reactions promote self-sustained combustion for smaller
	size particles at low pressure regimes. Calculated burning times
	are also consistent with experimental measurements. In O2/Ar, surface
	chemistry is more important when particles are small (under 20 µm)
	which guides the combustion to a more kinetically-limited regime
	than a diffusion-limited regime. The importance of surface reactivity
	is different regarding the particle size and the atmosphere of interest.
	Calculations of alumina residue size reveals that surface reactions
	could explain alumina residue formation. The model predicts a strong
	oxidizer effect on alumina residue size. According to the model,
	CO2 environment lead to large residue size while H2O environment
	lead to small residue size. This work definitely stresses the potential
	role of heterogeneous reactions in aluminum combustion.},

	350-1000nm range, and a high-resolution (0.04nm) instrument was used
	for observation of AlO molecular bands and non-ionized atomic aluminum.
	The temperature of condensed phase emitters in the flame was derived
	using polychromatic fitting of the continuum spectra to Planck’s
	law. AlO temperature was found by fitting of the theoretically calculated
	shape of the band to experimental data. Peak temperatures of the
	condensed emitters were found to be approximately 3250K in aluminum-air
	flames and approximately 3350K for oxygen-argon/helium flames. Temperatures
	derived from AlO spectra coincide with the temperature of the condensed
	emitters with measurement accuracy and are only 100-200°C lower than
	the computed equilibrium flame temperatures. The radial distribution
	of the temperature profile of the continuous emitters was found via
	Abel deconvolution and recovered the double-front structure of the
	Bunsen flame cone, with the outer flame being attributed to a diffusion
	flame of the fuel-rich products with ambient air. The observation
	of atomic aluminum lines seen in emission from the outer flame edge
	and partial self-absorption from the inner flame confirms the structure
	associated with the double-front structure. The implications of these

	the first step for calculation of the particle velocity profile,
	the Lagrangian approach of particle motion is employed, and then
	thermophoretic, gravitational and buoyancy forces are taken into
	consideration. In order to simulate the temperature profile for the
	thermophoretic force, it is assumed that the flame structure consists
	of three zones: preheat, reaction, and post flame (burned). It should
	be noted that the radiative heat-transfer equation is employed to
	describe the thermal radiation exchanged between the burned zone
	and the preheat zone. In the resumption, a control volume above the
	leading edge of the combustion zone is considered and the change
	in the particle number density in this volume is obtained via the
	balance of particle mass fluxes passing through it. The results show
	that the induced thermal radiation plays a significant role in increasing
	the mixture temperature all over the preheat zone, and that the particle

	as a function of distance from the leading edge of the combustion

	free-moving objects with dispersed multi-phase flows, however due
	to the challenge and complexity of modelling these systems, modelling
	approaches remain very limited and very few studies have been reported.
	This work presents a new method capable of addressing these problems.
	It integrates a dynamic meshing approach, used to explicitly capture
	the flow induced by free-moving large object(s), with a conventional
	CFD-DEM method to capture the behaviour of small particles in particle-fluid
	flow. The force and torque acting on the large object due to the
	fluid flow are explicitly calculated by integrating pressure and
	viscous stress acting on the object's surface and the forces due
	to collisions with both the smaller particles and other structures
	are calculated using a soft-sphere DEM approach. The developed model
	has been fully implemented on the ANSYS/Fluent platform due to its
	efficient handling of dynamic meshing and complex and/or free-moving
	boundaries, thus it can be applied to a wide range of industrial
	applications. Validation tests have been carried out for two typical
	gas-solid fluidization cases, they show good qualitative and quantitative
	agreement with reported experimental literature data. The developed
	model was then successfully applied to gas fluidization with a large
	immersed tube which was either fixed or free-moving. The predicted
	interacting dynamics of the gas, particle and tube were highly complex
	and highlighted the value of fully resolving the flow around the
	large object. The results demonstrated that the capability of a conventional
	CFD-DEM approach could be enhanced to address free-body fluid-structure
	interaction problems encountered in particle-fluid systems.},

	applied to atmospheric boundary-layer simulations. Such a method
	may form an attractive alternative to static grids for studies on
	atmospheric flows that have a high degree of scale separation in
	space and/or time. Examples include the diurnal cycle and a convective
	boundary layer capped by a strong inversion. For such cases, large-eddy
	simulations using regular grids often have to rely on a subgrid-scale
	closure for the most challenging regions in the spatial and/or temporal
	domain. Here we analyze a flow configuration that describes the growth
	and subsequent decay of a convective boundary layer using direct
	numerical simulation (DNS). We validate the obtained results and
	benchmark the performance of the adaptive solver against two runs
	using fixed regular grids. It appears that the adaptive-mesh algorithm
	is able to coarsen and refine the grid dynamically whilst maintaining
	an accurate solution. In particular, during the initial growth of
	the convective boundary layer a high resolution is required compared
	to the subsequent stage of decaying turbulence. More specifically,
	the number of grid cells varies by two orders of magnitude over the
	course of the simulation. For this specific DNS case, the adaptive
	solver was not yet more efficient than the more traditional solver
	that is dedicated to these types of flows. However, the overall analysis
	shows that the method has a clear potential for numerical investigations

  abstract  = {A high-order, central, essentially non-oscillatory (CENO), finite-volume
	scheme in combination with a block-based adaptive mesh refinement
	(AMR) algorithm is proposed for solution of the Navier-Stokes equations
	on body-fitted multi-block mesh. In contrast to other ENO schemes
	which require reconstruction on multiple stencils, the proposed CENO
	method uses a hybrid reconstruction approach based on a fixed central
	stencil. This feature is crucial to avoiding the complexities associated
	with multiple stencils of ENO schemes, providing high-order accuracy
	at relatively lower computational cost as well as being very well
	suited for extension to unstructured meshes. The spatial discretization
	of the inviscid (hyperbolic) fluxes combines an unlimited high-order
	k-exact least-squares reconstruction technique following from the
	optimal central stencil with a monotonicity-preserving, limited,
	linear, reconstruction algorithm. This hybrid reconstruction procedure
	retains the unlimited high-order k-exact reconstruction for cells
	in which the solution is fully resolved and reverts to the limited
	lower-order counterpart for cells with under-resolved/discontinuous
	solution content. Switching in the hybrid procedure is determined
	by a smoothness indicator. The high-order viscous (elliptic) fluxes
	are computed to the same order of accuracy as the hyperbolic fluxes
	based on a k-order accurate cell interface gradient derived from
	the unlimited, cell-centred, reconstruction. A somewhat novel h-refinement
	criterion based on the solution smoothness indicator is used to direct
	the steady and unsteady mesh adaptation. The proposed numerical procedure
	is thoroughly analyzed for advection-diffusion problems characterized
	by the full range of Péclet numbers, and its predictive capabilities
	are also demonstrated for several inviscid and laminar flows. The
	ability of the scheme to accurately represent solutions with smooth
	extrema and yet robustly handle under-resolved and/or non-smooth
	solution content (i.e., shocks and other discontinuities) is shown.
	Moreover, the ability to perform mesh refinement in regions of under-resolved
	and/or non-smooth solution content is also demonstrated.},

  abstract  = {The world is facing energy shortage and has become increasingly depending
	on new methods to store and convert energy for new, environmentally
	friendly methods of transportation and electrical energy generation
	as well as for portable electronics. Mobility - the transport of
	people and goods - is a socioeconomic reality that will surely increase
	in the coming years. Non-renewable fossil fuels are projected to
	decline sharply after 20-30 years. CO2 emission from burning such
	fuels is the main cause for global warming. Currently whole world
	is seeking international commitment to cut emissions of greenhouse
	gases by 60% by 2050. Hydrogen which can be produced with little
	or no harmful emissions has been projected as a long term solution
	for a secure energy future. Increasing application of hydrogen energy
	is the only way forward to meet the objectives of Department of Energy
	(DOE), USA, i.e. reducing green house gases, increasing energy security
	and strengthening the developing countries economy. Any transition
	from a carbon-based/fossil fuel energy system to a hydrogen based
	economy involves overcoming significant scientific, technological
	and socio-economic barriers before ultimate implementation of hydrogen
	as the clean energy source of the future. Lot of research is going
	on in the world to find commercially viable solutions for hydrogen
	production, storage, and utilization, but hydrogen storage is very
	challenging, as application part of hydrogen energy totally depend
	on this. During early nineties and now also hydrogen storage as gas,
	liquid and metal hydride has been undertaken to solve the problem
	of hydrogen storage and transportation for the utilization as hydrogen
	energy, but none of these roots could became commercially viable
	along with the safety aspects for gas and liquid. With the result
	many new novel materials appeared involving different principles
	resulting in a fairly complex situation with no correlation between
	any two materials. In the present review article the fundamental
	understanding of the physical, chemical and structural properties
	of light weight hydride materials, e.g. Alanates, Borohydrides, Amide
	Borohydrides, Amide-Imide system, Amineborane and Alane for hydrogen
	storage has been presented. Lot of details of these materials has
	been incorporated such as synthesis, crystal structure, thermodynamics
	and kinetics of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation processes, reversibility
	and hydrogen storage capacity has been presented.},

  title = {Reduction behavior of iron oxides in hydrogen and carbon monoxide
	atmospheres},
  journal = {Applied Catalysis A: General},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {326},
  pages = {17--27},

  abstract = {The reduction of various iron oxides in hydrogen and carbon monoxide
	atmospheres has been investigated by temperature programmed reduction
	(TPRH2 and TPRCO), thermo-gravimetric and differential temperature
	analysis (TG-DTA-MS), and conventional and “in situ” XRD methods.
	Five different compounds of iron oxides were characterized: hematite
	α-Fe2O3, goethite α-FeOOH, ferrihydrite Fe5HO8·4H2O, magnetite Fe3O4
	and wüstite FeO. In the case of iron oxide-hydroxides, goethite and
	ferrihydrite, the reduction process takes place after accompanying
	dehydration below 300°C. Instead of the commonly accepted two-stage
	reduction of hematite, 3 α-Fe2O3→2 Fe3O4→6 Fe, three-stage mechanism
	3Fe2O3→2Fe3O4→6FeO→6Fe is postulated especially when temperature
	of reduction overlaps 570°C. Up to this temperature the postulated
	mechanism may also involve disproportionation reaction, 3Fe2+⇌2Fe3++Fe,
	occurring at both the atomic scale on two-dimensional interface border
	Fe3O4/Fe or stoichiometrically equivalent and thermally induced,
	above 250°C, phase transformation--wüstite disproportionation to
	magnetite and metallic iron, 4FeO⇌Fe3O4+Fe. Above 570°C, the appearance
	of wüstite phase, as an intermediate of hematite reduction in hydrogen,
	was experimentally confirmed by “in situ” XRD method. In the case
	of FeO-H2 system, instead of one-step simple reduction FeO→Fe, a
	much more complex two-step pathway FeO→Fe3O4→Fe up to 570°C or even
	the entire sequence of three-step process FeO→Fe3O4→FeO→Fe up to
	880°C should be reconsidered as a result of the accompanying FeO
	disproportionation wüstite⇌magnetite+iron manifesting its role above
	150°C and occurring independently on the kind of atmosphere--inert
	argon or reductive hydrogen or carbon monoxide. The disproportionation
	reaction of FeO does not consume hydrogen and occurs above 200°C
	much easier than FeO reduction in hydrogen above 350°C. The main
	reason seems to result from different mechanistic pathways of disproportionation
	and reduction reactions. The disproportionation reaction wustite⇌magnetite+iron
	makes simple wüstite reduction FeO→Fe a much more complicated process.
	In the case of thermodynamically forced FeO disproportionation, the
	oxygen sub-lattice, a closely packed cubic network, does not change
	during wüstite→magnetite transformation, but the formation of metallic
	iron phase requires temperature activated diffusion of iron atoms
	into the region of inter-phase FeO/Fe3O4. Depending on TPRH2 conditions
	(heating rate, velocity and hydrogen concentration), the complete
	reduction of hematite into metallic iron phase can be accomplished
	at a relatively low temperature, below 380°C. Although the reduction
	behavior is analogical for all examined iron oxides, it is strongly
	influenced by their size, crystallinity and the conditions of reduction.},

  abstract  = {The free propagation of isobaric flames through aluminum dust clouds
	is investigated in an extensive series of experiments using two facilities
	with different scales. In small-scale laboratory experiments, spherical
	flame propagation occurs in aluminum dust clouds contained within
	30-cm-diameter latex balloons, whereas in large-scale tests, flames
	propagate vertically through unconfined aluminum dust clouds with
	a vertical scale of about 4 m. The balloon experiments are performed
	with suspensions of aluminum powder in oxygen mixed with nitrogen,
	argon, or helium with various concentrations of oxygen and aluminum.
	It is found that stable flame propagation is only observed for aluminum
	concentrations near stoichiometric to rich conditions. Pulsating
	and spiral-like flames are discovered in fuel-lean mixtures, and
	flames with cellular patterns occur in very-fuel-rich suspensions.
	The burning velocities in the stable propagation regime derived from
	the balloon experiments correlate well with data previously obtained
	with stabilized Bunsen-type flames. The flame speed of stable flames
	is found to be a strong function of the heat conductivity of the
	gas mixture. In addition, the oxygen concentration has a strong influence
	on the flame speed for fuel-rich mixtures but dependence is reduced
	for fuel-lean mixtures. In the large-scale experiments, the burning
	velocity is estimated to be about two times larger than for the small-scale
	experiments.  The increase in burning velocity is attributed to preheating
	of the unburned mixture by radiation from the condensed-phase combustion
	products. The degree of preheating, determined with an array of fine
	thermocouples, is found to be in the range of 150-200 K. The propagation
	of stable flames is discussed in light of existing qualitative dust
	flame models, whereas the pulsating flame propagation regime observed
	is interpreted in terms of the thermo-diffusive instability theory
	developed for high Lewis number flames in gases and solid reactive
	powder mixtures.},

	(PLIF) is adapted and used to measure oxygen absorption at three
	gas flow rates. The liquid is a mixture of water, ethanol and glycerol.
	A ruthenium complex is used as a fluorescence indicator. By combining
	PLIF with dynamic fluorescence quenching, local concentration fields
	are visualized and determined through image processing. The results
	show that the local mass transfer coefficient decreases in the flow
	direction on a smooth inclined plate. Compared to a completely smooth
	surface, the local mass transfer tends to be enhanced in the direct
	vicinity of a single microstructure. The impact of the microstructure
	on local mass transfer depends on the gas flow conditions and the
	measurement position. The highest local mass transfer coefficients
	are measured, where the local film thickness is lowered due to the
	structure and with lower gas flow rates.},

	challenge, not only due to the multiscale interactions with the turbulent
	combustion process but the equally complex physical and chemical
	processes that drive the conversion of gas-phase fuel molecules into
	solid-phase particles. In particular, soot formation is highly sensitive
	to the gas-phase composition and temporal fluctuations in a turbulent
	background flow. In this work, a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework
	is used to study the soot formation in a model aircraft combustor
	with swirl-based fuel and air injection. Two different configurations
	are simulated: one with and one without secondary oxidation jets.
	Specific attention is paid to the LES numerical implementation such
	that the discrete solver minimizes the dissipation of kinetic energy.
	Simulation of the model combustor shows that the LES approach captures
	the two recirculation zones necessary for flame stabilization very
	accurately. Further, the model reasonably predicts the temperature
	profiles inside the combustor. The model also captures variation
	in soot volume fraction with global equivalence ratio. The structure
	of the soot field suggests that when secondary oxidation jets are
	present, the inner recirculation region becomes fuel lean, and soot
	generation is completely suppressed. Further, the soot field is highly
	intermittent suggesting that a very restrictive set of gas-phase

	of the Al particles with air. The model equations are integrated

	Numerical simulations of the explosion fields from 1.5-g shock-dispersed-fuel

	flow (length 6 m, height 35 mm, the length is about 170 channel heights)
	are presented using phase-Doppler anemometry for simultaneous determination
	of air and particle velocity. The particles were spherical glass
	beads with mean diameters in the range of 60 µm-1 mm. The conveying
	velocity could be varied between about 10 m/s and 25 m/s, and the
	particle mass loading could reach values of about 2 (the mass loading
	is defined as the ratio of particle to gas phase mass flow rates),
	depending on particle size. For the first time, the degree of wall
	roughness could be modified by exchanging the wall plates. The influence
	of these parameters and the effect of inter-particle collisions on
	the profiles of particle mean and fluctuating velocities and the
	normalised concentration in the developed flow were examined. It
	was shown that wall roughness decreases the particle mean velocity
	and enhances fluctuating velocities due to irregular wall bouncing
	and an increase in wall collision frequency, i.e. reduction in mean
	free path. Thereby, the larger particles are mainly more uniformly
	distributed across the channel, and gravitational settling is reduced.
	Both components of the particle velocity fluctuation were reduced
	with increasing mass loading due to inter-particle collisions and
	the momentum loss involved. Moreover, the effect of the particles
	on the air flow and the turbulent fluctuations was studied on the
	basis of profiles in the developed flow and turbulence spectra determined
	for the streamwise velocity component. In addition to the effect
	of particle size and mass loading on turbulence modulation, the influence
	of wall roughness was analysed. It was clearly shown that increasing
	wall roughness also results in a stronger turbulence dissipation
	due to two-way coupling.},

	was clearly observed from light emission intensity (monitored by
	a photodiode) and pressure fluctuations (monitored by a pressure

	of periodic perturbations of the recirculation zone behind the bluff-body.
	These periodic perturbations are themselves caused by strong periodic
	overpressure variations due to stiff contraction downstream responding
	to gas velocity fluctuations. This feed-back-loop mechanism was considered

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a new Eulerian multi-fluid modeling for
	dense sprays of evaporating liquid droplets which is able to describe
	droplet coalescence and size polydispersion as well as the associated
	size-conditioned dynamics. It is an uncommon feature of Eulerian
	spray models which are required in a number of non-stationary simulations
	because of the optimization capability of a solver coupling a Eulerian
	description for both phases. The chosen framework is the one of laminar
	flows or the one of direct numerical simulations since no turbulence
	models are included in the present study. The model is based on a
	rigorous derivation from the kinetic level of description (p.d.f.
	equation) and can be considered as a major extension of the original
	sectional method introduced by Tambour et al. We obtain a set of
	conservation equations for each “fluid”: a statistical average of
	all the droplets in given size intervals associated to a discretization
	of the size phase space. The coalescence phenomenon appears as quadratic
	source terms, the coefficients of which, the collisional integrals,
	can be pre-calculated from a given droplet size discretization and
	do not depend on space nor time. We validate this Eulerian model
	by performing several comparisons, for both stationary and non-stationary
	cases, to a classical Lagrangian model which involves a stochastic
	algorithm in order to treat the coalescence phenomenon. The chosen
	configuration is a self-similar 2D axisymmetrical decelerating nozzle
	with evaporating sprays having various size distributions, ranging
	from smooth ones up to Dirac delta functions through discontinuous
	ones. We show that the Eulerian model, if the discretization in the
	size phase space is fine enough (the problem is then 3D unstationary,
	2D in space and 1D in size), is able to reproduce very accurately
	the non-stationary coupling of evaporation, dynamics and coalescence.
	Moreover, it can still reproduce the global features of the behavior
	of the spray with a coarse size discretization, which is a nice feature
	compared to Lagrangian approaches. The computational efficiency of
	both approaches are then compared and the Eulerian model is proved
	to be a good candidate for more complex and realistic configurations.},

	military provided direct financial incentives to offset investment
	costs of selected drop-in biofuel demonstration facilities. It is

	of a full-scale advanced biofuel supply chain capable of meeting
	US military demands, given limited availability of low-cost sustainable
	biomass feedstocks in some areas and considering the uncertainty
	in global oil prices. The objective of this work is to determine
	1) whether a state in the US can meet its share of military biofuel
	targets from local biomass resources, and 2) if direct financial
	incentives can expedite the development of the military biofuel supply
	chain, under two different oil price scenarios. The Biofuel supply
	chain GeoSpatial and Temporal Optimizer (BioGeSTO), was developed
	for that purpose and applied to the state of California, USA from
	2020 to 2040. The BioGeSTO model determined that biomass resources
	in California can meet 12-19% of its annual military targets between
	2020 and 2040 of renewable diesel and biojet fuel using the Fischer-Tropsch
	(FT) and Hydro-Treatment of Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) conversion
	technologies. However, under the reference oil price scenario, only
	HEFA conversion facilities introduced at 2027 in Kings County were
	found feasible. Under the high oil price scenario, both the HEFA
	and FT technologies were financially feasible and the supply chain
	production approaches the theoretical production limit by 2032. In
	both scenarios, providing investment incentives has a modest impact
	on expediting the supply chain, as facilities are introduced only
	1-3 years earlier when receiving direct investment incentives. Sensitivity
	analysis shows that biomass availability has the greatest impact
	on the supply chain performance such that a 50% increase in the baseline
	amount of biomass feedstock results in a 150% surge in the total
	cumulative production. In conclusion, the reference oil price scenario
	drastically limits the ability of California to meet its military
	drop-in biofuel targets. Assuming a high oil price scenario, the
	state may be able to meet military biofuel targets by subsidizing
	local biomass production and importing the rest of the biomass required
	for this purpose from the northwestern states of Washington and Oregon.},

  abstract = {A method for generating three-dimensional, time-dependent turbulent
	inflow data for simulations of complex spatially developing boundary
	layers is described. The approach is to extract instantaneous planes
	of velocity data from an auxiliary simulation of a zero pressure
	gradient boundary layer. The auxiliary simulation is also spatially
	developing, but generates its own inflow conditions through a sequence
	of operations where the velocity field at a downstream station is
	rescaled and re-introduced at the inlet. This procedure is essentially
	a variant of the Spalart method, optimized so that an existing inflow-outflow
	code can be converted to an inflow-generation device through the
	addition of one simple subroutine. The proposed method is shown to
	produce a realistic turbulent boundary layer which yields statistics
	that are in good agreement with both experimental data and results
	from direct simulations. The method is used to provide inflow conditions
	for a large eddy simulation (LES) of a spatially evolving boundary
	layer spanning a momentum thickness Reynolds number interval of 1530-2150.
	The results from the LES calculation are compared with those from
	other simulations that make use of more approximate inflow conditions.
	When compared with the approximate inflow generation techniques,
	the proposed method is shown to be highly accurate, with little or
	no adjustment of the solution near the inlet boundary. In contrast,
	the other methods surveyed produce a transient near the inlet that
	persists several boundary layer thicknesses downstream. Lack of a
	transient when using the proposed method is significant since the
	adverse effects of inflow errors are typically minimized through
	a costly upstream elongation of the mesh. Extension of the method
	for non-zero pressure gradients is also discussed.},

	combustion oxygen is transferred from the combustion air to the gaseous

	are never mixed, and the gases from the oxidation of the fuel, CO2
	and H2O, leave the system as a separate stream. The H2O can easily
	be removed by condensation and pure CO2 is obtained without any loss
	of energy for separation. This makes chemical-looping combustion
	a most interesting alternative to other CO2 separation schemes, which
	have the drawback of a large energy consumption. A design of a boiler
	with chemical-looping combustion is proposed. The system involves
	two interconnected fluidized beds, a high-velocity riser and a low-velocity
	bed. Metal oxide particles are used as oxygen carrier. The reactivities
	needed for oxygen carriers to be suitable for such a process are

	of Fe2O3 and NiO. The data available on oxygen carriers, although

  abstractnote = {Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a combustion technology with inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO{sub 2}. The technique involves the use of a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier which transfers oxygen from combustion air to the fuel, and hence a direct contact between air and fuel is avoided. Two inter-connected fluidized beds, a fuel reactor and an air reactor, are used in the process. In the fuel reactor, the metal oxide is reduced by the reaction with the fuel and in the air reactor; the reduced metal oxide is oxidized with air. The outlet gas from the fuel reactor consists of CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O, and almost pure stream of CO{sub 2} is obtained when water is condensed. Considerable research has been conducted on CLC in the last years with respect to oxygen carrier development, reactor design, system efficiencies and prototype testing. In 2002 the process was a paper concept, albeit with some important but limited laboratory work on oxygen carrier particles. Today more than 600 materials have been tested and the technique has been successfully demonstrated in chemical-looping combustors in the size range 0.3 - 50 kW, using different types of oxygen carriers based on the metals Ni, Co, Fe, Cu and Mn. The total time of operational experience is more than a thousand hours. From these tests it can be established that almost complete conversion of the fuel can be obtained and 100% CO{sub 2} capture is possible. Most work so far has been focused on gaseous fuels, but the direct application to solid fuels is also being studied. Moreover, the same principle of oxygen transfer is used in chemical-looping reforming (CLR), which involves technologies to produce hydrogen with inherent CO{sub 2} capture. This paper presents an overview of the research performed on CLC and CLR highlights the current status of the technology},

  abstract  = {Metal combustion is currently under discussion as a possible basis
	for a closed energy loop. One potential metal with several benefits
	for such a process is lithium. While the reaction products in conventional
	combustion processes are gaseous, the reaction products of lithium
	combustion are solid (Li2CO3, Li2O) and, hence, easy to capture and
	to recycle. The current paper describes the lay-out and optimization
	of a 100 MWth lithium slag tap furnace by computational fluid dynamics
	(CFD) using CO2 as oxidizer for the lithium. ANSYS Fluent has been
	extended by two lithium combustion models developed by the authors.
	The first reference model is one-step model directly converting Li
	to Li2CO3, neglecting the intermediate species Li2O. The second extended
	model is a two-step model considering Li2O as intermediate species.
	Simulations were carried out using a fixed geometry of the slag tab,
	varying the injection angle of gas and lithium spray and the CO2-Li
	ratio with respect to the lithium conversion level and lithium product
	capture efficiency. The simulations show that a high capture efficiency
	of lithium combustion products is possible when a large injection
	angle is used. The conversion level is highly dependent on injection
	angle, CO2-Li ratio and the Li combustion model used. While the conversion
	level of the reference model is inherently limited and lies between
	84 and 87.6%, the extended model predicts significantly higher conversion
	levels in the order of 96.7-99.2% which would be needed for industrial
	application.},

  abstract  = {A novel implicit second-order accurate immersed boundary method (IBM)
	for simulating the flow around arbitrary stationary bodies is developed,
	implemented and validated in this paper. The IBM is used to efficiently
	take into account the existence of bodies within the fluid domain.
	The flow domain consist of simple Cartesian cells whereas the body
	can be arbitrary. At the triangulated interface of the body and the
	fluid, the immersed boundary, the coefficients obtained from discretizing
	the Navier-Stokes equations are closed with a second-order accurate
	interpolation arising from the immersed boundary condition employed
	at the interface. Two different conditions are developed in this
	paper and it is shown that for the mirroring method the resulting
	coefficients lead to a well-posed and diagonally dominant system
	which can be efficiently solved with a preconditioned Krylov sub-space
	solver. The immersed boundary condition generates a fictitious reversed
	velocity field inside the immersed boundary, which is excluded from
	the continuity equation to account for the presence of the IB in
	the pressure correction equation, resulting in no mass flux over
	the IB. The force acting on the object from the fluid is determined
	by integrating the pressure and the viscous forces over the object.
	The method is validated by simulating the flow around a sphere for
	a range of Re numbers. It is shown that the drag is very well in
	agreement with experimental data. Accuracy and convergence studies
	are employed, proving the second-order accuracy of the method and
	showing the superiority in convergence rate compared to other IBM.
	Finally the drag force of a cluster of non-spherical particles is
	employed to show the generality and potential of the method.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses two stochastic approaches to computing the propagation
	of uncertainty in numerical simulations: polynomial chaos and stochastic
	collocation. Chebyshev polynomials are used in both cases for the
	conventional, deterministic portion of the discretization in physical
	space. For the stochastic parameters, polynomial chaos utilizes a
	Galerkin approximation based upon expansions in Hermite polynomials,
	whereas stochastic collocation rests upon a novel transformation
	between the stochastic space and an artificial space. In our present
	implementation of stochastic collocation, Legendre interpolating
	polynomials are employed. These methods are discussed in the specific
	context of a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle flow with uncertainty in
	inlet conditions and nozzle shape. It is shown that both stochastic
	approaches efficiently handle uncertainty propagation. Furthermore,
	these approaches enable computation of statistical moments of arbitrary
	order in a much more effective way than other usual techniques such
	as the Monte Carlo simulation or perturbation methods. The numerical
	results indicate that the stochastic collocation method is substantially
	more efficient than the full Galerkin, polynomial chaos method. Moreover,
	the stochastic collocation method extends readily to highly nonlinear
	equations. An important application is to the stochastic Riemann
	problem, which is of particular interest for spectral discontinuous
	Galerkin methods.},

  abstract  = {Metal powder combustion has traditionally been studied to mitigate
	the risk of industrial accidents and to determine the contributions
	of metals as additives to the performance of energetic materials.
	Recently, there has been growing interest in exploring the potential
	of metal powders as recyclable, zero-carbon energy carriers as an
	alternative to the hydrocarbons known to contribute to climate change.
	The present work introduces, for the first time, a stabilized flat
	iron flame. The counterflow burner used in this work is comprised
	of an inverted ceramic nozzle which sits above, and is aligned axially
	with, a lower nozzle producing a laminar flow of particles suspended
	in an oxidizing gas. A stabilized methane flame sits inside the top
	nozzle and the hot combustion products impinge upon the two-phase
	flow from the bottom nozzle, creating a stagnation plane. Spherical
	iron powder, with 90% of the particles less than 2.5 µm in size,
	is pre-loaded into a piston and dispersed using mixtures of 30% and
	40% oxygen balanced in argon. Flame speeds are measured using particle
	image velocimetry (PIV), while flame temperatures are determined
	using multicolour pyrometry. It is found that flame speeds range
	between 30 cm/s and 45 cm/s for both oxidizing mixtures. Despite
	having fuel loadings below stoichiometric concentrations, the observed
	particle combustion temperatures are close to the adiabatic flame
	temperature of the stoichiometric mixture, indicating combustion
	in the diffusion-controlled regime for these small particles. Finally,
	the independence of the flame speeds with respect to oxygen concentration
	suggests flame propagation in the discrete regime.},

	flame with local extinction and reignition. The transported scalar
	PDF approach is applied to the turbulence-chemistry interaction.
	The turbulent flow field is obtained with a nonlinear two-equation
	turbulence model. A C1 skeletal scheme is used as the chemistry model.
	The performance of three micromixing models is compared: the interaction
	by exchange with the mean model (IEM), the modified Curl's coalescence/dispersion
	model (CD) and the Euclidean minimum spanning tree model (EMST).
	With the IEM model, global extinction occurs. With the standard value
	of model constant C ϕ = 2 , the CD model yields a lifted flame, unlike
	the experiments, while with the EMST model the correct flame shape
	is obtained. However, the conditional variances of the thermochemical
	quantities are underestimated with the EMST model, due to a lack
	of local extinction in the simulations. With the CD model, the flame
	becomes attached when either the value of C ϕ is increased to 3 or
	the pilot flame thermal power is increased by a factor of 1.5. With
	increased value of C ϕ better results for mixture fraction variance
	are obtained with both the CD and the EMST model. Lowering the value
	of C ϕ leads to better predictions for mean temperature with EMST,
	but at the cost of stronger overprediction of mixture fraction variance.
	These trends are explained as a consequence of variance production
	by macroscopic inhomogeneity and the specific properties of the micromixing
	models. Local time stepping is applied so that convergence is obtained
	more quickly. Iteration averaging reduces statistical error so that
	the limited number of 50 particles per cell is sufficient to obtain
	accurate results.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a probabilistic approach to
	turbulent polydispersed two-phase flows. The two-phase flows considered
	are composed of a continuous phase, which is a turbulent fluid, and
	a dispersed phase, which represents an ensemble of discrete particles
	(solid particles, droplets or bubbles). Gathering the difficulties
	of turbulent flows and of particle motion, the challenge is to work
	out a general modelling approach that meets three requirements: to
	treat accurately the physically relevant phenomena, to provide enough
	information to address issues of complex physics (combustion, polydispersed
	particle flows, …) and to remain tractable for general non-homogeneous
	flows. The present probabilistic approach models the statistical
	dynamics of the system and consists in simulating the joint probability
	density function (pdf) of a number of fluid and discrete particle
	properties. A new point is that both the fluid and the particles
	are included in the pdf description. The derivation of the joint
	pdf model for the fluid and for the discrete particles is worked
	out in several steps. The mathematical properties of stochastic processes
	are first recalled. The various hierarchies of pdf descriptions are
	detailed and the physical principles that are used in the construction
	of the models are explained. The Lagrangian one-particle probabilistic
	description is developed first for the fluid alone, then for the
	discrete particles and finally for the joint fluid and particle turbulent
	systems. In the case of the probabilistic description for the fluid
	alone or for the discrete particles alone, numerical computations
	are presented and discussed to illustrate how the method works in
	practice and the kind of information that can be extracted from it.
	Comments on the current modelling state and propositions for future
	investigations which try to link the present work with other ideas
	in physics are made at the end of the paper.},

  abstract  = {Despite recent advances in numerical methods for multiphase flows,
	the complete simulation of a liquid spray is still an illusive goal.
	There are few models that can describe accurately both the primary
	and secondary atomization simultaneously. The biggest difficulty
	is the wide range of length scales involved; from millimetres in
	the largest liquid structures close to the smallest micron-size droplets.
	This wide range makes Direct Numerical Simulation of sprays very
	expensive all scales need to be resolved and expensive algorithms
	are required to reconstruct accurately the interface. Large eddy
	simulations are becoming increasingly popular in turbulent flows
	due to their better description of turbulence and the relative robustness
	of sub-grid stress models. Despite its advantages, large eddy simulation
	cannot describe accurately fluid structures that occur at sub-grid
	levels. This paper presents a new model to describe the atomization
	process. The method consist of solving a joint sub-grid probability
	density function of liquid volume and surface using stochastic methods.
	The approach can simulate both dense and dilute regions of the spray.
	The proposed model can determine instantaneous sub-grid liquid structures
	(droplets) distributions as well as to capture the primary break-up.
	The results of the simulations are compared to a Direct Numerical
	Simulation of a Diesel Jet break-up. The mean liquid volume and surface
	density are well predicted; The modelling of the sub-grid scales
	is shown to be fundamental in the dilute regions of the spray.},

  abstract  = {The accurate description and robust simulation, at relatively low
	cost, of global quantities (e.g. number density or volume fraction)
	as well as the size distribution of a population of fine particles
	in a carrier fluid is still a major challenge for many applications.
	For this purpose, two types of methods are investigated for solving
	the population balance equation with aggregation, continuous particle
	size change (growth and size reduction), and nucleation: the extended
	quadrature method of moments (EQMOM) based on the work of Yuan et
	al. [52] and a hybrid method (TSM) between the sectional and moment
	methods, considering two moments per section based on the work of
	Laurent et al. [30]. For both methods, the closure employs a continuous
	reconstruction of the number density function of the particles from
	its moments, thus allowing evaluation of all the unclosed terms in
	the moment equations, including the negative flux due to the disappearance
	of particles. Here, new robust and efficient algorithms are developed
	for this reconstruction step and two kinds of reconstruction are
	tested for each method. Moreover, robust and accurate numerical methods
	are developed, ensuring the realizability of the moments. The robustness
	is ensured with efficient and tractable algorithms despite the numerous
	couplings and various algebraic constraints thanks to a tailored
	overall strategy. EQMOM and TSM are compared to a sectional method
	for various simple but relevant test cases, showing their ability
	to describe accurately the fine-particle population with a much lower
	number of variables. These results demonstrate the efficiency of
	the modeling and numerical choices, and their potential for the simulation
	of real-world applications.},

	In contrast to conventional solution methods based on the Monte Carlo
	approach, we use a finite?volume method combined with adaptive mesh
	refinement (AMR) applied in both physical and compositional space.
	The obvious advantage of this over a uniform grid is that fine meshes
	are only used where the solution requires high resolution. The efficiency
	of the method is demonstrated by a number of tests involving a turbulent
	jet flow with up to two scalars (both reacting and non?reacting).
	We find that the AMR calculation can be at a fraction of the computer
	cost of a uniform grid calculation with the same accuracy. Copyright

  abstract  = {The rate of flame propagation is generally understood to directly
	reflect the burning rate of a combustible mixture, as it is proportional
	to the square root of the overall reaction rate in the flame. However,
	in the case of heterogeneous mixtures composed of spatially separated
	discrete heat sources, such as suspensions of solid-fuel particles,
	theory suggests that the flame propagation speed may become insensitive
	to the reaction rate. Such a flame propagation regime, known as the
	“discrete flame” in the literature, is predicted to occur in suspensions
	of fast-burning metal particles and (or) low-conductivity gas media
	where the flame propagation becomes dominated by the heat transfer
	between fast-burning heat sources. In an attempt to experimentally
	confirm the existence of the discrete flame regime, flame fronts
	propagating in transparent glass tubes through iron particle (d32=33 µm)
	suspensions in low-thermal-diffusivity oxygen/xenon mixtures were
	studied in a high-quality microgravity environment. The experiment
	was performed on board the European Space Agency MAXUS-9 sounding
	rocket that lifted off from the Esrange Space Center (Sweden) on
	April 7, 2017. In total, 41 combustion runs were completed in suspensions
	with 20% and 40% of oxygen content during the 12 min of microgravity.
	While the experimentally determined combustion time of a single iron
	particle differs by a factor of more than three in mixtures with
	20% and 40% oxygen content, the flames in these mixtures were found
	to propagate with practically equal speed in accordance with the
	predictions of the discrete flame theory.},

	fluid in a region containing immersed boundaries which move with
	the fluid and exert forces on the fluid. An example of such a boundary
	is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement
	of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes
	equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem
	involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by
	replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the
	mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from
	the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations
	of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points
	need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the Î´ function is introduced.
	Because the boundary forces are of order hâ1, and because they
	are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend
	to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by
	an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method
	which takes into account the displacements that will be produced
	by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied

	The under-resolution is worst for low Karlovitz number combustion,

	chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars.
	Here, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable,
	which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable,
	which tracks the global extent of reaction of the local mixture.
	The mapping functions, which describe all of the detailed chemical
	processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined
	by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex
	chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance
	of the new model is compared to fast-chemistry and steady-flamelet
	models for predicting velocity, species concentration, and temperature
	fields in a methane-fuelled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental
	data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture
	the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and
	to obtain good agreement with the experimental data, while the fast-chemistry
	and steady-flamelet models both predict an attached flame.},

	velocity field minimizes the residual kinetic energy, and that, with
	the ideal model, the method yields the correct one-time behaviour
	as determined by the Navier-Stokes equations. The approach is extended
	to the self-conditioned probability density function (PDF) of compositions.
	Compared to LES formulations based on the filtered velocity and the
	filtered density function, the self-conditioned field approach has
	several advantages: for laminar flow, and in the direct-numerical-simulation
	limit, the residual fluctuations are zero or exponentially small;
	full account is taken of the probability distribution of turbulent
	fields; there are no commutation issues; and there are no issues
	with filtering at walls, where the self-conditioned velocity is zero.
	The exact evolution equations for the self-conditioned velocity and

	highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations

	of turbulence statistics should depend minimally on Δ provides an
	alternative justification for the dynamic procedure.},

	and species concentrations have strong effects on chemical and radiative
	heat sources. Turbulence-chemistry interactions (TCI) and turbulence-radiation
	interactions (TRI) create a set of “closure” problems when the governing
	partial differential equations are averaged. The presumed probability
	distribution function (presumed-PDF) method assumes a form of probability
	distribution function to close the chemical source term. The emphasis
	of this work is developing a high-fidelity radiation model that works
	in tandem with combustion models that use the presumed-PDF method
	to close the turbulent source terms. A finite volume based photon
	Monte Carlo method with a line-by-line spectral model is applied
	with the presumed-PDFs of mixture fraction, scalar dissipation rate
	and enthalpy defect to account for TRI effects. An efficient wavenumber
	selection scheme is proposed for the line-by-line photon Monte Carlo
	method considering TRI. The model is validated with one-dimensional
	exact line-by-line solutions for different TRI treatments and with
	a coupled combustion simulation for an open jet flame.},

  abstract  = {Energy is one of the basic requirements in our daily lives. Daily
	activities such as cooking, cleaning, working on the computer and
	commuting to work are more or less dependent on energy. The world's
	energy demand is continuously increasing over the years due to the
	ever-increasing growth in the human population as well as economic
	development. At present, approximately 90% of energy demands are
	fulfilled by fossil fuels. With the rising demands of energy throughout
	the globe, it can be expected that the availability of fossil fuels
	is depleting at an alarming rate since fossil fuels are non-renewable
	sources of energy. In addition, fossil fuels are the main contributor
	of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore, they have a detrimental
	impact on human health and environment in the long term. Hence, there
	is a critical need to develop alternative sources of energy in replacement
	of fossil fuels. Hydrogen fuels have gained much interest among researchers
	all over the world since they are clean, non-toxic and renewable,
	making them suitable for use as substitutes for petroleum-derived
	fuels in vehicular applications. However, the greatest challenge
	in using hydrogen fuels lies in the development of hydrogen storage
	systems, especially for on-board applications. Hydrogen fuels can
	be stored in gaseous, liquid or solid states, and much effort has
	been made to develop hydrogen storage systems that are safe, cost-effective,
	environmental-friendly and more importantly, with high energy densities.
	Current technologies used for hydrogen storage include high-pressure
	compression at about 70 MPa, liquefaction at cryogenic temperatures
	(20 K) and absorption into solid state compounds. Among the three
	types of hydrogen storage technologies, the storage of hydrogen in
	solid state compounds appears to be the most feasible solution since
	it is a safer and more convenient method compared to high-pressure
	compression and liquefaction technologies. In this regard, metal
	hydrides are potential chemical compounds for solid-state hydrogen
	storage, and a large number of studies have been carried out to synthesize
	low-cost metal hydrides with low absorption/desorption temperatures,
	high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage densities, good
	resistance to oxidation, good reversibility and cyclic ability, fast
	kinetics and reactivity, and moderate thermodynamic stability. In
	general, these studies have shown that the absorption/desorption
	properties of hydrogen can be improved by: (1) the addition of catalysts
	into the metal hydrides, (2) alloying the metal hydrides, or (3)
	nanostructuring. This review article is focused on the latest developments
	of metal hydrides for solid-state hydrogen storage applications,
	which will be of interest to scientists, researchers, and practitioners
	in this field.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new mesoscale model simulating the gas phase
	fluid dynamics and concentration distribution in structured packings,
	used in absorption and distillation columns. The model describes
	the structured packing as an arrangement of triangular channel sections
	and is implemented with an own developed mesoscale simulation code
	(StructuPack). The velocity field is stored at the cell faces and
	is driven by pressure, inertial and viscous forces. The coupled continuity
	and momentum equations are solved with the SIMPLE-algorithm, that
	is usually applied in CFD solvers. The development of the model is
	based on fundamental investigations with CFD simulations and experiments,
	described in the first part of the paper. Particularly, the concentration
	distribution in a representative geometry of structured packings,
	a single crisscrossing junction of triangular channels, is analysed.
	As one result of the fundamental investigations the CFD solver could
	be validated as a predictive tool with respect to concentration distribution
	for the laminar regime in structured packings. In the second part,
	the mesoscale model is described in detail and validated with a scenario
	of tracer distribution in a packing layer. By means of comparison
	with CFD simulations of the same scenario it was shown that the mesoscale
	model has the ability to yield good representations of concentration,
	pressure and velocity profiles in a structured packing. Thereby the
	mesoscale computational performance was three orders of magnitudes
	more efficient with respect to CFD. At the advent of high-performance
	computing this means that models at intermediate scale are a viable
	tool to simulate scenarios like maldistribution effects in industrial
	sized structured packings of distillation and absorption columns.},

	been improved by adding an appropriate catalyst into the system and
	as well as by ball-milling that introduces defects with improved

  abstract  = {Lithium combustion has been studied for several decades, with a primary
	focus on safety issues, such as lithium fires resulting from spills
	in nuclear reactors. Several studies have also considered the use
	of lithium as a fuel within propellants, or within propulsion systems
	that burn lithium in the atmospheric “air” of other planets. Lithium
	safety has typically been investigated through combustion of molten
	pieces of lithium or within pool fires. For propulsion applications,
	experiments were carried out using packed beds of lithium particles.
	A novel approach that has recently been proposed is the use of lithium
	as a recyclable fuel, or energy carrier that can compactly store
	renewable energy. In this scheme, lithium is burned with air, or
	power-plant exhaust, to generate heat for thermal power systems when
	power is needed. The solid-phase combustion products would be collected
	and recycled, via electrolysis, back into elemental lithium when
	excess renewable power is available. This paper summarizes the existing
	knowledge on lithium combustion. It presents the available findings
	on lithium combustion for large single pieces of lithium, on pool
	fires, reaction in packed beds, as well as the combustion of sub-mm
	sized particles and droplets which are needed for the use of lithium
	as an energy carrier. The combustion reactions of lithium with O2,
	H2O, CO2 and N2 are discussed. Modelling of lithium-particle combustion
	is at the early stages of development and available results are discussed.},

	In the current work, combustion experiments for single lithium particles

	show, the duration of the gas-phase combustion is approximately ten
	times shorter compared to the surface reaction. In addition, the
	burnout times of both combustion stages increase clearly for lower

	efficiency is possible if the truncation error functions as physically

	With this model we are able to reach very long integration times

	strongly affects the solution. If the truncation error functions
	as a physically consistent subgrid-scale model (that is, it models
	the evolution of otherwise resolved scales), resolution may remain
	low. Thereby, computational efficiency is improved. The sixth-order
	adaptive central-upwind weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme
	with implicit scale separation, denoted as WENO-CU6-M1, potentially
	allows for physically consistent implicit subgrid-scale modeling,
	when shaped accordingly. In this work, finding an optimal formulation
	of WENO-CU6-M1 is considered within a deterministic design optimization
	framework. Possible surrogate modeling and sampling strategies are
	considered. Design optimization is based on evaluating the potential
	of a WENO-CU6-M1 scheme formulation to reproduce Kolmogorov scaling
	for a Taylor?Green vortex in its quasi-isotropic state. As in the
	absence of physical viscosity, kinetic energy dissipates exclusively
	due to the subgrid-scales, the Reynolds number is infinite, and the
	evolution of the flow is determined by proper subgrid-scale modeling.
	To complete the work, the effective numerical dissipation rate of
	the WENO-CU6-M1 model optimized for artificially compressible fluid

	In engineering applications, resolution is often low. In these underresolved
	regions, the truncation error of the underlying numerical schemes
	strongly affects the solution. If the truncation error functions
	as a physically consistent subgrid-scale model (that is, it models
	the evolution of otherwise resolved scales), resolution may remain
	low. Thereby, computational efficiency is improved. The sixth-order
	adaptive central-upwind weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme
	with implicit scale separation, denoted as WENO-CU6-M1, potentially
	allows for physically consistent implicit subgrid-scale modeling,
	when shaped accordingly. In this work, finding an optimal formulation
	of WENO-CU6-M1 is considered within a deterministic design optimization
	framework. Possible surrogate modeling and sampling strategies are
	considered. Design optimization is based on evaluating the potential
	of a WENO-CU6-M1 scheme formulation to reproduce Kolmogorov scaling
	for a Taylor?Green vortex in its quasi-isotropic state. As in the
	absence of physical viscosity, kinetic energy dissipates exclusively
	due to the subgrid-scales, the Reynolds number is infinite, and the
	evolution of the flow is determined by proper subgrid-scale modeling.
	To complete the work, the effective numerical dissipation rate of
	the WENO-CU6-M1 model optimized for artificially compressible fluid
	flows is quantified, and it is compared to the original one. Not
	only is the zero viscosity limit considered, but the model behavior
	is benchmarked offdesign, for low to high Reynolds numbers. A comparison
	to an alternative explicit and implicit subgrid-scale model demonstrates
	its superior behavior for the chosen test flow.},

	a flat flame stabilized in a suspension of micron-sized aluminum.
	The results from the combination of diagnostics are used to infer
	the combustion regime of the particles and to estimate the characteristic
	combustion time of the suspension. It is observed that the reaction
	zone of the flame in stoichiometric aluminum-air suspensions exhibits
	strong self-reversal of the atomic aluminum emission lines. These
	lines also exhibit high optical depths in both emission and absorption
	spectroscopy. The strong self-reversal and high optical depths indicate
	high concentrations of aluminum vapor within the reaction zone of
	the flame at multiple temperatures. These features provide evidence
	of the formation of vapor-phase micro-diffusion flames around the
	individual particles in the suspension. In aluminum-methane-air flames,
	the lack of self-reversal and lower optical depths of the aluminum
	atomic lines indicate the absence of vapor-phase micro-diffusion
	flames, and point to a more heterogeneous, and likely kinetically-controlled,
	particle combustion regime. The reaction zone thickness is estimated
	from the spatially resolved profiles of aluminum resonance lines
	in both absorption and emission through the flame. The emission measurements
	yield a reaction zone thickness on the order of 1.7±0.3 mm in aluminum-air
	flames, and the absorption measurements yield a thickness on the
	order of 2.3±0.5. It is demonstrated that the combination of the
	combustion zone thickness measurement, flame temperatures determined
	from molecular AlO emission spectra, and particle velocity measurements
	from the PIV diagnostic permits an estimation of the burning time
	in the suspension. The burning time in stoichiometric aluminum-air
	suspensions using the suite of diagnostics is estimated to be on

	For stoichiometric methane-air mixtures, the transition occurs in
	the aluminum concentration range of 140-220g/m3 and is manifested
	by the appearance of AlO sub-oxide bands and an increase in the flame
	temperature to 2500K. The flame burning velocity is found to decrease
	only slightly with an increase in aluminum concentration, in contrast
	to the rapid decrease in flame speed, followed by quenching, that

	that considers ideal, non-volatile fuel particles undergoing heterogeneous
	reaction controlled by a combination of diffusion and kinetic rates.
	This approximation is useful to describe the combustion behavior
	in suspensions of refractory metal-fuel particles, where the lack
	of significant premixing of fuel vapor with oxidizer can lead to
	combustion in a diffusion micro-flame enveloping the particle. The
	transition from kinetic heterogeneous-fuel oxidation to diffusion-controlled
	combustion occurs via thermal runaway, customarily called particle
	ignition. There is, however, a critical particle size below which
	an individual particle cannot ignite at any temperature, and the
	combustion will be controlled by heterogeneous kinetics at a temperature
	close to that of the bulk gas. While individual particles may not
	be able to ignite, the collective effect, which results from the
	self-heating of particle suspensions to thermal runaway, can enable
	fast reaction in suspensions. Micron- and sub-micron-sized fuel particles
	are used for their high reactivity, but such particles often agglomerate
	before combustion. The ignition and combustion behavior of an agglomerate
	can be drastically different from its isolated constituent particles
	due to a large internal surface area inside of the agglomerate that
	is partially accessible to oxidizer, while only the external surface
	area of the agglomerate is available for heat loss. It is shown that
	the interplay between the thermal regimes of reaction, the collective
	effects of the suspension, and the collective effects of agglomeration
	can lead to a wide range of observed ignition and combustion phenomena
	that are independent of the material-specific fuel and oxide properties.},

	the influence of both diffusional and kinetic rates on the particle
	combustion process. It is assumed that particles react via a single-step,
	first-order Arrhenius surface reaction with an oxidizer delivered
	to the particle surface through gas diffusion. Unlike the majority
	of models previously developed for flames in suspensions, no external
	parameters are imposed, such as particle ignition temperature, combustion
	time, or the assumption of either kinetic- or diffusion-limited particle
	combustion regimes. Instead, it is demonstrated that these parameters
	are characteristic values of the flame propagation problem that must
	be solved together with the burning velocity, and that the a priori
	imposition of these parameters from single-particle combustion data
	may result in erroneous predictions. It is also shown that both diffusive
	and kinetic reaction regimes can alternate within the same flame
	and that their interaction may result in non-trivial flame behavior.
	In fuel-lean mixtures, it is demonstrated that this interaction leads
	to certain particle size ranges where burning velocity increases
	with increasing particle size, opposite to the expected trend. For
	even leaner mixtures, the interplay between kinetic and diffusive

	In this manner, stochastic ordinary differential equations for the

	constraint and not the instantaneous one. As a consequence, one has
	to introduce a stochastic density, which differs from the physical

  abstract = {A general theory of ignition and combustion of nano- and micron-sized
	aluminum particles is developed. The oxidation process is divided
	into several stages based on phase transformations and chemical reactions.
	Characteristic time scales of different processes are compared to
	identify physicochemical phenomena in each stage. In the first stage,
	the particle is heated to the melting temperature of the aluminum
	core. Key processes are heat and mass transfer between the gas and
	particle surface and diffusion of mass and energy inside the particle.
	The second stage begins upon melting of the aluminum core. Melting
	results in pressure buildup, thereby facilitating mass diffusion
	and/or cracking of the oxide layer. Melting is followed by polymorphic
	phase transformations, which also results in the formation of openings
	in the oxide layer. These provide pathways for the molten aluminum
	to react with the oxidizing gas; the ensuing energy release results
	in ignition of nano-aluminum particles. For large micron-sized particles,
	ignition is not achieved due to their greater volumetric heat capacity.
	In the third stage, nanoparticles undergo vigorous self-sustaining
	reactions with the oxidizing gas. Reactions typically occur heterogeneously
	in the particle and the burning rate is controlled by chemical kinetics.
	For large micron-sized particles, polymorphic phase transformations
	result in the formation of a crystalline oxide layer. The oxide layer
	melts and particle ignition is achieved. In the fourth stage, the
	large micron-sized particle burns through gas-phase or surface reactions,
	depending on the oxidizer and pressure. The burning rate is controlled
	by mass diffusion through the gas-phase mixture.},

	on the performance of the CBS-Q and G2 methods observed in other

	mode of particles in iron dust flames. Iron powders of different
	particle sizes varying from 3 to 34μm were dispersed in simulated
	air compositions where nitrogen was replaced by argon and helium.
	Due to the independence of the particle burning rate on the oxygen
	diffusivity in the kinetic mode, the ratio between the flame speeds
	in helium and argon mixtures is expected to be smaller if the particle
	burning rate is controlled by reaction kinetics rather than oxygen
	diffusion. Experiments were performed in a reduced-gravity environment
	on a parabolic flight aircraft to prevent particle settling and buoyancy-driven
	disruption of the flame. Uniform suspensions of the iron powders
	were produced inside glass tubes and a flame was initiated at the
	open end of the tube. Quenching plate assemblies of various channel
	widths were installed inside the tube and pass or quench events were
	used to measure the quenching distance. Flame propagation was recorded
	by a high-speed digital camera and spectral measurements were used
	to determine the temperature of the condensed emitters in the flame.
	The measured flame speeds and quenching distances were in good agreement
	with previously developed one-dimensional, dust flame model where
	the particles are assumed to burn in a diffusive mode and heat losses
	are described on a volumetric basis. However, a significant drop
	of the ratio of flame speeds in helium and argon mixtures was observed
	for finer 3μm particles and was attributed to a transition from the
	combustion controlled by diffusion for larger particles to kinetically
	controlled burning of micron-size particles. In helium mixtures,
	the lower flame temperatures measured in suspensions of fine particles
	in comparison to larger particles reinforces this assumption.},

	of gas-solid flow is dependent on accurate models for unclosed terms
	that appear in the averaged equations for mass, momentum and energy
	conservation. In the multifluid theory, the second moment of particle
	velocity represents the strength of particle velocity fluctuations
	and is known to play an important role in the prediction of core-annular
	flow structure in risers (Hrenya and Sinclair, AIChEJ, 43 (4) (1994)
	[5]). In homogeneous suspensions the evolution of the second velocity
	moment is governed by the particle acceleration-velocity covariance.
	Therefore, fluctuations in the hydrodynamic force experienced by
	particles in a gas-solid flow affect the evolution of particle velocity
	fluctuations, which in turn can affect the mean and variance of the
	hydrodynamic force. This coupling has been studied in the limit of
	Stokes flow by Koch and co-workers using a combination of kinetic
	theory and multipole expansion simulations. For Reynolds numbers
	beyond the Stokes limit, direct numerical simulation is a promising
	approach to quantify this coupling. Here we present direct numerical
	simulation (DNS) results for the evolution of particle granular temperature
	and particle acceleration variance in freely evolving homogeneous
	gas-solid suspensions. It is found that simple extension of a class
	of mean particle acceleration models to their corresponding instantaneous
	versions does not recover the correlation of particle acceleration
	with particle velocity. This study motivates the development of better
	instantaneous particle acceleration models that are able to accurately
	capture the coupling between particle acceleration and velocity.},

  abstract  = {Soot particle dynamics, including particle size distributions (PSDs)
	and related statistics, are of increasing practical significance
	due to evolving regulatory demands. The combination of a mass and
	number density preserving sectional model with a transported joint
	probability density function (JPDF) method ensures a full coupling
	of the joint scalar space, e.g. soot and gas phase reactions and
	radiative heat losses, within a method that can represent ignition/extinction
	phenomena as well as the slow (low Damköhler number) soot inception
	and oxidation chemistry in turbulent flames. This approach is here
	applied to the sooting non-premixed Sandia ethylene jet flame via
	a 78-dimensional joint-scalar space, including enthalpy, gas phase
	species and 62 soot sections. Soot nucleation is treated as a global
	step from acetylene to pyrene with the rate fitted using comparisons
	with full detailed chemistry. Soot surface growth is treated via
	a PAH analogy and soot oxidation is considered via O, OH and O2 using
	a Hertz-Knudsen approach. Comparisons with measured temperature,
	gas phase species and the mean soot volume fraction show good agreement
	while the introduction of zero soot diffusivity leads to substantially
	improved predictions of the RMS of the soot volume fraction. The
	calculated PSDs at the burner centreline show a transition from one
	to two-peaks along the axial direction with the mode of the second
	peak increasing from 14 to 32 nm. Scatter plots, joint statistics
	of soot parameters and temperature, and the chemical source terms
	across soot sections suggest that surface growth is dominant when
	PSDs are unimodal and that the competition of oxidation, coagulation/aggregation
	and surface growth leads to a PSD shape transition. It is also shown
	that local extinction events lead to the presence of soot in cool
	fuel lean mixtures.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical method for the simulation of fluid-structure

	fluids and a large number of slender viscoelastic Cosserat rods.
	Because of their high flexibility and low weight the rods considered
	here exhibit large deflections, even under moderate fluid loads.
	Their motion, in turn, modifies the flow so that fluid and structures
	are strongly coupled to each other which is numerically very challenging.
	The paper proposes a new coupling approach based on an immersed boundary
	method which improves upon existing methods for this problem. It
	is numerically stable and exempt from any global iteration between
	the fluid part and the structure part, thus yielding high stability
	and low computational cost of the coupling scheme. The contribution
	presents the underlying methodology and its algorithmic realization,

	and the closure relations, resulting in much confusion in the literature.
	These various forms in the literature and in commercial codes are
	reviewed and the resulting hydrodynamics through CFD simulations
	of fluidized beds compared. Experimental data on fluidized beds of
	Hilligardt and Werther (1986), Kehoe and Davidson (1971), Darton
	et al.(1977), and Kuipers (1990) are used to quantitatively assess
	the various treatments. Predictions based on the commonly used governing
	equations of Ishii (1975) do not differ from those of Anderson and
	Jackson (1967) in terms of macroscopic flow behavior, but differ
	on a local scale. Flow predictions are not sensitive to the use of
	different solid stress models or radial distribution functions, as
	different approaches are very similar in dense flow regimes. The
	application of a different drag model, however, significantly impacts
	the flow of the solids phase. A simplified algebraic granular energy-balance
	equation is proposed for determining the granular temperature, instead
	of solving the full granular energy balance. This simplification
	does not lead to significantly different results, but it does reduce
	the computational effort of the simulations by about 20%.},

	is capable of providing reasonable predictions of the time-averaged
	properties. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of the gas-solids
	behaviour at different superficial gas velocities, at different column
	diameters, and at different pressures are evaluated, namely (A) the
	velocity of pressure and voidage waves through the bed, (B) the power
	of the low and high frequencies of the pressure and voidage fluctuations,
	(C) the reorientation of the gas-solids flow just above minimum fluidisation
	and the effect of elevated pressure upon this reorientation, and
	(D) the Kolmogorov entropy. The CFD simulation results for items

	tracing in particle fields is the influence region of a ray. Two
	ways of modeling a ray are proposed. In the first, each ray is treated
	as a standard volume-less line. In the other approach, the ray is
	assigned a small solid angle, and is thus treated as a cone with
	a decaying influence function away from its centerline. Based on
	these models, three different interaction schemes between rays and

  abstract  = {The collision rate of monodisperse solid particles in a turbulent
	gas is governed by a wide range of scales of motion in the flow.
	Recent studies have shown that large-scale energetic eddies are the
	dominant factor contributing to the relative velocity between two
	colliding particles (the turbulent transport effect), whereas small-scale
	dissipative eddies can enhance the collision rate significantly by
	inducing local non-uniform particle distribution (the accumulation
	effect). The turbulent transport effect is most noticeable when the
	particle inertial response time τp is of the order of the flow integral
	timescale and the accumulation effect is most pronounced when τp
	is comparable to the flow Kolmogorov time.We study these two contributions
	separately through direct numerical simulations. The two effects
	are quantified carefully with a numerical procedure that is independent
	of the computation of average collision rate. This facilitates the
	study of not only the statistical description of the collision kernel,
	but also the relative contributions and modelling of the two physical
	effects. Simulations at several flow Reynolds numbers were performed
	to suggest a model for the accumulation effect. The data show that
	the accumulation effect scales linearly with flow Taylor microscale
	Reynolds number Rλ, while the theory for fully developed turbulence
	indicates that the maximum level of the turbulent transport effect
	scales with R1/2λ. Finally, an integrated model has been developed
	to predict the collision rate at arbitrary flow Reynolds numbers
	and particle inertia.},

	produce both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. The flow pattern
	was described using a computational fluid dynamics model; characteristics
	of the turbulent flow were established and correlated with the particle
	combustion characteristics. Particle burn times and temperatures
	were measured optically. Effect of turbulent flow conditions was
	observed on combustion characteristics for both aluminum and titanium
	powders. For both powders, luminous combustion streaks became shorter.
	For aluminum, the brightness of the streak and the optically measured
	temperature were also substantially reduced in the turbulent flow
	conditions. For titanium, reduction in both streak brightness and
	temperature were minor for different flow conditions. The burn rates
	of aluminum were observed to increase more than 4 times in the turbulent
	flows compared to the burn rates measured for the same powder in
	laminar flow. For titanium, the burn rates in turbulent flows were
	approximately twice as fast as in the laminar flow. Simple empirical

	and particle diameter on the combustion of CO2/Ar and O2/Ar with
	micrometer-sized aluminum particles. The simulation results when
	varying the oxidizer compare well with experimental data. With CO2
	as the oxidizer, the trend of each simulated diameter follows that
	of the experimental data, especially the simulated 7μm particles
	compared to experimental data for a mass average diameter of 11μm.
	For oxygen, the simulated burn times with a particle size of 11μm
	has excellent agreement compared to experimental data with a mass
	average diameter of 11μm. The simulation results for both CO2/Ar
	and O2/Ar show a transition from kinetically-controlled combustion
	to diffusion-controlled combustion as the pressure increases. The
	burn time of the particles decreases as the pressure increases, until
	the diffusion-controlled combustion regime is reached and then the
	pressure has no effect on burn time. The opposite is true for the
	CO2 experimental data, in that the observed burn time increases with
	increasing pressure. The simulations indicate that the observed experimental
	trend could be the result of using a distribution of particle diameters.
	As the pressure decreases, larger particles may not ignite and the
	apparent burn time does not increase. The effect of particle diameter
	was also investigated. The effects of particle size, oxidizer, and
	oxidizer concentration on the calculated surface temperatures are
	also shown. This is the first model to show the beginning of the

	These results suggest that reduced soot surface growth rates with

	reduced H atom concentrations as temperatures decrease as a result
	of radiative heat losses. Primary soot particle nucleation rates
	exhibited variations with temperature and acetylene concentrations
	that were similar to recent observations for diffusion flames; however,
	nucleation rates in the premixed flames were significantly lower
	than in the diffusion flames for reasons that still must be explained.
	Finally, predictions of yields of major gas species based on mechanisms
	from both Frenklach and co-workers and Leung and Lindstedt were in
	good agreement with present measurements and suggest that H atom
	concentrations (relevant to HACA mechanisms) approximate estimates
	based on local thermodynamic equilibrium in the present flames.},

  abstract = {Metal combustion has received renewed interest largely as a result
	of the ability to produce and characterize metallic nanoparticles.
	Much of the highly desirable traits of nanosized metal powders in
	combustion systems have been attributed to their high specific surface
	area (high reactivity) and potential ability to store energy in surfaces.
	In addition, nanosized powders are known to display increased catalytic
	activity, superparamagnetic behavior, superplasticity, lower melting
	temperatures, lower sintering temperatures, and higher theoretical
	densities compared to micron and larger sized materials. The lower
	melting temperatures can result in lower ignition temperatures of
	metals. The combustion rates of materials with nanopowders have been
	observed to increase significantly over similar materials with micron
	sized particles. A lower limit in size of nanoenergetic metallic
	powders in some cases may result from the presence of their passivating
	oxide coating. Consequently, coatings, self-assembled monolayers
	(SAMs), and the development of composite materials that limit the
	volume of non-energetic material in the powders have been under development
	in recent years. After a brief review of the classifications of metal
	combustion based on thermodynamic considerations and the different
	types of combustion regimes of metal particles (diffusion vs. kinetic
	control), an overview of the combustion of aluminum nanoparticles,
	their applications, and their synthesis and assembly is presented.},

  abstract  = {Kinetic equations arise in a wide variety of physical systems and
	efficient numerical methods are needed for their solution. Moment
	methods are an important class of approximate models derived from
	kinetic equations, but require closure to truncate the moment set.
	In quadrature-based moment methods (QBMM), closure is achieved by
	inverting a finite set of moments to reconstruct a point distribution
	from which all unclosed moments (e.g. spatial fluxes) can be related
	to the finite moment set. In this work, a novel moment-inversion
	algorithm, based on 1-D adaptive quadrature of conditional velocity
	moments, is introduced and shown to always yield realizable distribution
	functions (i.e. non-negative quadrature weights). This conditional
	quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) can be used to compute exact
	N-point quadratures for multi-valued solutions (also known as the
	multi-variate truncated moment problem), and provides optimal approximations
	of continuous distributions. In order to control numerical errors
	arising in volume averaging and spatial transport, an adaptive 1-D
	quadrature algorithm is formulated for use with CQMOM. The use of
	adaptive CQMOM in the context of QBMM for the solution of kinetic
	equations is illustrated by applying it to problems involving particle
	trajectory crossing (i.e. collision-less systems), elastic and inelastic
	particle-particle collisions, and external forces (i.e. fluid drag).},

  volume = {224},
  pages = {2331--2358},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the behaviour of elongated, axi-symmetric
	ellipsoidal particles, their interaction with turbulence, and the
	effects of the ellipsoids on turbulence in a turbulent channel flow
	with Reτ = 150. The simulations are carried out with full four-way
	coupling using the point-source approach: the particles are affected
	by the fluid, the particles affect the fluid, and the particles can
	collide with each other or the wall using a realistic collision algorithm.
	The trajectories of the ellipsoids are tracked by solving the translational
	and rotational equations of motion in a Quaternion framework and
	are closed with hydrodynamic drag and torque laws. To specifically
	identify the effect of particle shape, simulations of single phase
	channel flow are compared to simulations with spherical particles
	and to simulations with ellipsoids. In all cases, the driving pressure
	drop, to establish a flow with Reτ = 150, is kept constant. Both
	the spherical particles and the ellipsoidal particles have a Stokes
	number of 5. Although the volume fraction is very low, 0.00725 and
	0.0219 % for the spheres and ellipsoids, respectively, there is some
	effect of the particles and the ellipsoids on the turbulence. Although
	the transport terms in the turbulent kinetic energy equation of the
	fluid are hardly affected, the turbulence kinetic energy itself decreases
	by 6.0 % for the flow laden with spherical particles and 4.8 % for
	the ellipsoidal particles. The homogeneous dissipation of turbulence
	kinetic energy by the fluid decreases due to the addition of particles,
	and the production also decreases. The particles dissipate turbulence
	kinetic energy of the fluid phase, predominantly in the near-wall
	region. Because there is a high average slip velocity in the stream-wise
	direction between the particles and the fluid in the near-wall region,
	the root mean square of the particle velocity is higher than that
	of the fluid velocity in this direction. In the other directions,
	the root mean square velocities of the particles are significantly
	lower than of the fluid. There is, however, a positive slip velocity
	between the particles and the fluid in the wall-normal direction,
	indicating that the particles move towards the wall with a higher
	momentum than that they return to the centre of the channel with.
	As a result, there is a 4-5 times higher concentration of particles
	near the wall than in the centre of the channel. As both the spherical
	and the ellipsoidal particles are very small, there is no major difference
	in their overall behaviour. However, in the near-wall region, there
	are some profound differences. The collision mechanism of ellipsoids
	with the walls is significantly different compared to spheres, the
	former predominantly inducing rotation resulting from a collision
	and the latter predominantly moving away from the wall after colliding.
	This is confirmed by the strong rotation as well as large root mean
	square of rotation of the ellipsoidal particles in the near-wall
	region. This results in a slight inward shift of the peak of the
	root mean square velocities of the fluid and the ellipsoidal particles
	as well as the peak in slip velocity, driving the momentum transfer,
	compared to the simulations with the spheres. Finally, the statistics
	of the orientation show that the ellipsoids align in the stream-wise
	direction in the near-wall region, because of the fluid boundary
	layer as well as the particle-wall collisions, but that there is
	no significant orientation of the ellipsoids outside of the near-wall
	region.},

	for a variety of propulsion and power systems to achieve optimal

	results, providing a convenient and accurate method for practical
	application. A parametric study illustrates that AMP ignition is
	affected by bulk flow velocity, radiation and oxygen concentration,
	particularly for AMP over 100 μm in diameter; in contrast, ANP is
	more sensitive to alumina thickness which generally raises both ignition
	temperature and ignition delay time. The present study not only deepens
	the fundamental understanding of aluminum combustion but also provides
	a guideline for prompting ignition.},

  abstract  = {We present a computational study of cluster-induced turbulence (CIT), where the production of fluid-phase kinetic energy results entirely from momentum coupling with finite-size inertial particles. A separation of length scales must be established when evaluating the particle dynamics in order to distinguish between the continuous mesoscopic velocity field and the uncorrelated particle motion. To accomplish this, an adaptive spatial filter is employed on the Lagrangian data with an averaging volume that varies with the local particle-phase volume fraction. This filtering approach ensures sufficient particle sample sizes in order to obtain meaningful statistics while remaining small enough to avoid capturing variations in the mesoscopic particle field. Two-point spatial correlations are computed to assess the validity of the filter in extracting meaningful statistics. The method is used to investigate, for the first time, the properties of a statistically stationary gravity-driven particle-laden flow, where particle-particle and fluid-particle interactions control the multiphase dynamics. Results from fully developed CIT show a strong correlation between the local volume fraction and the granular temperature, with maximum values located at the upstream boundary of clusters (i.e. where maximum compressibility of the particle velocity field exists), while negligible particle agitation is observed within clusters.},

In the present study, magnesium powder has been considered as a new possible energy carrier. In order to analyze more deeply the magnesium combustion and the generated by-products, short time stable magnesium/air flames have been realized in a combustion chamber using an oxy-acetylene flame for ignition. Sieved magnesium samples with two fractions were combusted: 20-50μm and 50-70μm. The power delivered by the Mg/air flame was estimated in the range 3-5kW. The gaseous emissions (O2, CO2 from oxy-acetylene combustion, NO and NO2) were analyzed with on-line analyzers and the particulate emissions were analyzed with an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI). The mass concentration of emitted particles whose size is smaller than 10μm was proved to be very high (up to 35g/(N)m3) and the emitted particles were mainly bigger than 1μm (84-97wt%). NOx emissions were higher for the 20-50μmMg fraction (NO average of 4300±200mg/(N)m3) than for the 50-70μmMg fraction (NO average of 1100±140mg/(N)m3).},

  abstract = {In this paper, the combustion mechanisms of aluminum particles suspended in air and dust flame propagation mechanisms in dust-air mixtures, more specifically, in aluminum dust-air mixture are reviewed. Experimental data about individual aluminum particles combustion are collected and explained with details. It is shown from previous studies that despite the well understanding of the individual particles combustion process, the ignition and the inter-particles interaction need more investigation seen that potential differences exist between the combustion regimes of isolated particles and a group of particles. The combustion regime may affect the ignition temperature resulting in the difference in the burning velocity. Additional experimental data and theoretical/numerical studies are needed. It is afterwards shown that, at these temperatures level, the thermal radiation contribution could be significant. Therefore, optical properties of aluminum burning particles and alumina particles are determined based on Mie scattering solutions showing that both aluminum and alumina are poor emitters but excellent scatterers. Then, several flame propagation models which take into account the thermal radiation exchanges are reviewed. The review of existing models reveals that the knowledge of the nature of radiative exchanges remains piecewise and basics need to be founded in order to be able to test modeling routes and plan experiments. The interaction of the different heat exchange modes and combustion regimes within the flame propagation process should be studied with a minimum of simplifying assumptions and the nature and characteristics of thermal radiation exchanges should be the key.},

  abstract = {Gas-solid fluidization technology has been commercialized in many industrial applications since its implementation in the fluid catalytic cracking process in the early 1940s, however, the understanding of the complex hydrodynamics of gas-solid flow inside fluidized beds is still far from satisfactory due to its dynamic and multiscale nature, especially, the critical role played by mesoscale structures. In recent decades, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an important toolkit in understanding the physics of complex gas-solid flow and then for the scale-up, optimization and design of gas-solid fluidized bed reactors. This article presented a pedagogical and comprehensive review to the Navier-Stokes order continuum theory for CFD simulation of the hydrodynamics of gas-solid fluidization, without taking the effects of heat and mass transfer as well as chemical reactions into consideration. A concise introduction to the methods for multiscale CFD simulation of gas-solid fluidization was firstly provided, which include direct numerical simulation, (coarse-grained) discrete particle method, kinetic method, continuum method and mesoscale-structure-based multiscale method. The underlying postulates of homogeneous continuum theory that assume the structure inside each computational cell is (nearly) homogeneous were then examined, followed by an overview of the constitutive relationships available in literature, including the particle phase stress models, the interphase drag models and the models for particle-wall interactions. The importance of mesoscale structures that take the form of gas bubbles and/or particle clusters and streamers in the quantification of the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flows was then addressed, and the explicit resolution (or highly resolved) method and implicit modeling method for quantifying the effects of mesoscale structures in continuum modeling of gas-solid fluidization were highlighted. Coarse grid simulation of large scale fluidized beds with proper mesoscale, sub-grid scale or turbulent models for constitutive relationships were then reviewed, focusing on the filtered method, turbulence modelling and heterogeneity-based method where the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) based method is a representative. Finally, the scope for the further research areas is described.},

Direct numerical simulations on a single aluminum droplet burning in a quiescent environment suggest that thermophoresis is the main mechanism driving smoke back to the aluminum surface, hence a major contributor to the oxide lobe development. The presence of this lobe is found to distort the flowfield, which favors hot and smoke-rich regions closer to the lobe, thereby enhancing thermophoresis. This combination of aerodynamic and thermophoretic effects leads to a mass rate of deposited smoke which is consistent with experimental data. A simplified model, deduced from simulation results, is able to predict the size of the final oxide residue in good agreement with measurements. This study supports that aluminum oxide present on the burning aluminum particle is largely due to material formed in the flame, subsequently desposited by thermophoresis.},

(2009) use a Bhatnagar, Gross, and Krook (BGK) approximation to the collision terms in a particle distribution function transport equation to model the effects of particle collisions on damping fluctuating particle velocities and, in gas/liquid/solid beds, fluctuating temperatures and compositions of liquid films on particle surfaces. In this paper we focus on particle flows in which the particles have no liquid films and report on an improved expression we have developed for the collision damping time of particle velocity fluctuations used in the BGK approximation. The improved expression includes the effects on the collision damping time of the particle material coefficient of restitution and of non-equilibrium particle velocity distributions. The collision model improvements are incorporated into the general-purpose computational-particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) numerical methodology for dense particle flows. Three computational examples show the benefits of using the new collision time in calculations of particle separation in polydisperse dense particle flows and calculations of colliding particle jets.},

  abstract = {An improved particle generator based on electrodynamic powder fluidization is proposed and constructed for investigating single metal particle’s combustion. The designed setup is able to generate a single metal particle moving upward with a well controlled velocity and trajectory and ignite it at near-uniform conditions by an infrared laser beam with flattened elliptical beam profile. Mechanically sieved narrow fractions of spherical iron particles with mean sizes in the range of around 26-54 μm were used in experiments. Particles burned in O2/N2 mixtures with oxygen content varying from 21% to 36%. Particle’s trajectories, velocities, and arbitrary radiant intensities were measured by taking images with a high-speed camera and processing them with an in-house developed data processing program. Two characteristic times associated with particle combustion were measured: 1) total duration of high-temperature phase (ttot) and 2) time to the maximum brightness (tmax). The results show that ttot and tmax can be described by a dn-law with 1.57≲n≲1.72 and 1.46≲n≲1.60, respectively. The effect of oxygen concentration on ttot, tmax, and tdec=ttot−tmax was analyzed for selected particle sizes of 30, 40, and 50 μm. It was found that tmax∝(1/XO2)n with 1.04≲n≲1.18 is almost linearly proportional to 1/XO2, while tdec shows a very weak dependency on the oxygen concentration at 26%-36%. This can be explained by the idea that the overall combustion process of iron is controlled by first external and then internal diffusion of oxygen owing to the saturation of oxygen on the particle surface.},

  abstract = {In some heterogeneous systems, such as dust clouds, the heat sources (i.e., particles) are separated by large spaces of a noncombustible, heat-conductive media. In spite of the clearly discrete nature of the heat sources in such systems, the source term in the energy conservation equation of the flame propagation models is commonly considered to be a continuous function of spatial coordinates. To analyze the validity of this assumption for dust flames, we have compared flame speeds predicted by two different flame models. One of the models is based on the common approximation of the heat sources by a continuos function of spatial coordinates, and the other considers the exact description of the coordinates of the burning particles. An analytical expression for the flame speed in the media with regularly distributed pointlike discrete heat sources (particles) has been obtained, and the parameter responsible for the relation between discrete and continuous models was identified. The flame speeds obtained from the continuous and discrete models coincide if the particle combustion time is much longer than the characteristic time of heat transfer between particles. In the opposite case, for the fast (compared with the time of heat transfer between particles) burning fuels, the flame speed in the discrete system is a weak function of the particle combustion rate and is an explicit function of the distance between particles. The effect of the discrete nature of the heat sources on flame propagation is illustrated by comparing flame speeds calculated both from continuous and discrete models in lean aluminum and zirconium particle-gassuspensions. Lower flame speeds and a weaker dependence of the speed on oxygen concentration are predicted by the discrete flame model. The possible effect of the nonuniform particle distribution in space on the flame propagation phenomena is also discussed in the present work.},

  abstract = {Scramjet propulsion systems can be the key to deliver the next generation of hypersonic planes. The high costs and complexity of gathering experimental data is a limiting factor in the development of such engine. In this context, numerical simulation has become increasingly popular to investigate supersonic combustion phenomena that otherwise would be prohibitively expensive. Despite recent progress, the simulation of high-speed compressible and reactive flows is still very challenging and presents many associated challenges. The chemical source term is highly non-linear and most combustion models are designed to operate in low-Mach number conditions. The present work investigates the use of Probability Density Function (PDF) in the context of Large Eddy Simulation models under supersonic conditions. Two approaches are considered: an extension of the joint scalar-enthalpy PDF for high-speed flows and a novel joint velocity-scalar-energy PDF model. Both formulations use the Eulerian stochastic fields approach implemented in a fully compressible density-based CFD code. The performance of the models are investigated in a supersonic lifted flame, comparing the stochastic formulations with traditional models that neglect sub-grid fluctuations. The results show that sub-grid contributions are important at coarse meshes and the stochastic fields approach can reproduce the experimental data and the scatter observed. The simulations suggest that the scalar-enthalpy PDF is the most robust formulations and the sub-grid closures of the joint velocity-scalar PDF need further investigation.},

  abstract = {Measurements are reported for the explosibility behavior in air of a variety of metallic and other elemental dusts. The data are useful for evaluating the hazards involved in their manufacture, transport, storage, and use. This study was also designed to help resolve, a fundamental issue of whether the combustion reactions in those dust flames proceed homogeneously in the gas phase or heterogeneously at particle surfaces. Data are reported for 14 dusts: from the more volatile metals such as magnesium and zinc, to the refractory metals such as tantalum, tungsten and niobium. Also included are some intermediate metals: hafnium, titanium, aluminum, iron, lead and copper; as well as the nonmetallic elements: boron, silicon, and carbon. Explosion pressures, rates of pressure rise, and continuum radiation temperatures were measured as a function of the dispersed dust concentration, using the Bureau of Mines 20-L explosibility test chamber and strong pyrotechnic ignitors. The lean limit fuel equivalence ratios varied from as low as 0.13 for the more reactive and volatile dusts to well in excess of 1.0 for the less reactive and less volatile ones. The copper and lead dusts were nonexplosible. For some dusts, preliminary data on particle size dependencies were obtained. The data are analyzed in terms of calculated adiabatic flame temperatures and the equilibrium vapor pressures or nonequilibrium vapor fluxes at those temperatures. An inverse correlation is observed between the measured lean limit equivalence ratio and the calculated equilibrium flame zone volatility for the dust. The correlation is analogous to one previously established for the carbonaceous dusts. Estimated absolute vaporization fluxes for the more flammable dusts are adequate to support a homogenous mechanism. Some refractory dusts, however, exhibit marginal (but finite) explosibility for the finer particle sizes even though their estimated vaporization fluxes appear to be too low to support a homogeneous mechanism.},

We performed direct numerical simulations at Reynolds number 600 and employed proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to extract the dominant modes and their temporal coefficients. We then applied the identification algorithm, N4SID, to construct an estimator that captures the relation between the velocity signals at sensor points (input) and the POD coefficients (output). We show that the first pair of modes can be very well reconstructed using the velocity time signal from even a single sensor point. A larger number of points improves accuracy and robustness and also leads to better reconstruction for the second pair of POD modes. Application of the estimator derived at Re = 600 to the flows at Re = 500 and 700 shows that it is robust with respect to changes in operating conditions.},

For the LES method, the subgrid-scale effects were modelled using the standard Smagorinsky model, while for the RANS method the standard k-ɛ model was used. The interaction between the rotating impeller and the static baffles was accounted for using the sliding-deforming mesh methodology. Comparisons were made between the predictions and previously reported phase-resolved LDA measurements of mean and rms velocities, as well as turbulent kinetic energy. The results obtained with the LES approach capture well both the overall as well as the detailed flow features (such as the trailing vortices) and show very substantial improvement in comparison to RANS predictions with the standard k-ɛ model. The global turbulent energy dissipation rate (ɛ) across the vessel volume was also well predicted by the LES, to within 15% of the measured value; in contrast, ɛ was underpredicted by 45% with the RANS model.

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms contributing to flame stabilization and blowout in a nitrogen-diluted hydrogen transverse jet in a turbulent boundary layer cross-flow (JICF) are investigated using three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) with detailed chemistry. Non-reacting JICF DNS were performed to understand the relative magnitude and physical location of low velocity regions on the leeward side of the fuel jet where a flame can potentially anchor. As the injection angle is reduced from 90° to 70°, the low velocity region was found to diminish significantly, both in terms of physical extent and magnitude, and hence, its ability to provide favorable conditions for flame anchoring and stabilization are greatly reduced. In the reacting JICF DNS a stable flame is observed for 90° injection angle and, on average, the flame root is in the vicinity of low velocity magnitude and stoichiometric mixture. When the injection angle is smoothly transitioned to 75° a transient flame blowout is observed. Ensemble averaged quantities on the flame base reveal two phases of the blowout characterized by a kinematic imbalance between flame propagation speed and flow normal velocity. In the first phase dominant flow structures repeatedly draw the flame base closer to the jet centerline resulting in richer-than-stoichiometric mixtures and high velocity magnitudes. In the second phase, in spite of low velocity magnitudes and a return to stoichiometry, due to jet bending and flame alignment normal to the cross-flow, the flow velocity normal to the flame base increases dramatically perpetuating the blowout.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the velocity and turbulence characteristics of a round turbulent jet in crossflow are reported. The experiments were conducted in a water channel, 8.53 m long, 0.61 m wide, and 1.067 m deep, of the recirculation type. Water was injected vertically upward from a circular pipe located near the channel bottom to simulate the turbulent jet. Normal and 45 deg-slanted fiber-film probes along with appropriate anemomenters and bridges were operated in the constant temperature mode to measure mean velocities, turbulence intensities, Reynolds stresses, structural parameters, correlation coefficients, and the turbulent kinetic energy. The measurements were carried out in the jet and its wake both in and outside the jet plane of symmetry. Details of the jet-wake cross section (including the vortex region) were revealed at a number of downstream locations using constant velocity and turbulence intensity contours.},

  abstract = {The flow and heat transfer characteristics of an impinging laminar square jet through cross-flow have been investigated numerically by using the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes and energy equations in steady state. The simulations have been carried out for jet to cross-flow velocity ratios between 0.5 and 10 and for nozzle exit to plate distances between 1D and 6D, where D is the jet width. The complex nature of the flow field featuring a horseshoe vortex has been investigated. The calculated results show that the flow structure is strongly affected by the jet-to-plate distance. In addition, for jet-to-plate spacing of one jet width and for jet to cross-flow velocity ratios less than 2.5 an additional peak occurs at about three-dimensional downstream of the jet impingement point. For high jet to cross-flow ratios two horseshoe vortices form around the jet in the case of small jet-to-plate spacings.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a nonlinear stabilization technique for scalar conservation laws with implicit time stepping. The method relies on an artificial diffusion method, based on a graph-Laplacian operator. It is nonlinear, since it depends on a shock detector. Further, the resulting method is linearity preserving. The same shock detector is used to gradually lump the mass matrix. The resulting method is LED, positivity preserving, and also satisfies a global DMP. Lipschitz continuity has also been proved. However, the resulting scheme is highly nonlinear, leading to very poor nonlinear convergence rates. We propose a smooth version of the scheme, which leads to twice differentiable nonlinear stabilization schemes. It allows one to straightforwardly use Newton’s method and obtain quadratic convergence. In the numerical experiments, steady and transient linear transport, and transient Burgers’ equation have been considered in 2D. Using the Newton method with a smooth version of the scheme we can reduce 10 to 20 times the number of iterations of Anderson acceleration with the original non-smooth scheme. In any case, these properties are only true for the converged solution, but not for iterates. In this sense, we have also proposed the concept of projected nonlinear solvers, where a projection step is performed at the end of every nonlinear iterations onto a FE space of admissible solutions. The space of admissible solutions is the one that satisfies the desired monotonic properties (maximum principle or positivity).},

A transport equation that provides the local residence time field is derived by the balance on a control volume of a variable denominated ”quantity of residence time”. A similar transport equation has been derived previously, but a more general expression is obtained through the present derivation. While the earlier equation is applicable to steady state, constant density flows, the equation proposed here can be applied to transient flows where density changes occur. The derivation also clarifies how to treat boundary conditions, a matter that has raised uncertainty in previous works. Furthermore, the concept of residence time of a chemical species is introduced, and the corresponding equation is formulated for specific cases.},

  abstract = {Probability density functions (PDF) and the relevant methods have been widely used to describe non-linear phenomena in the realm of turbulence modelling and CFD. In order to solve PDF transport equations, the main trend of previous studies rely on Monte Carlo method with Lagrangian particle tracking. However, as with any Lagrangian based approach, the scalability of the parallelized simulations of such method is less than satisfactory. An Eulerian stochastic field model has been presented recently by Dumond et al. [1] to simulate cavitating flows. Their model uses a fully compressible density based solver. Here we present an adapted version using an iso-thermal cavitation model adopting the homogeneous mixture assumption in a pressure based flow solver which is more relevant to engine simulations. A PDF method is used to represent a distribution of vapour volume fractions, based on which the Eulerian stochastic field (ESF) method is applied to perform a three-dimensional large eddy simulation (LES) of the cavitation phenomena inside an academic fuel injector configuration. The numerical model is based on a volume of fluids approach and coupled with a pressure based solver for the flow field, and is implemented in the framework of the open source C++ toolbox OpenFOAM. The result of the ESF simulation is compared against that from a typical single volume fraction solver for validation. Vortex structures and its correspondence to cavitation are shown, and the behaviour of the PDF at different probe locations at different times are acquired to demonstrate the potential of the ESF model in capturing both transient and stochastically steady cavitation.},

  abstract = {A new experimental apparatus that can produce Bunsen-type premixed dust flames stabilized on a water-cooled ring has been contructed. The burning velocities in rich aluminum dust clouds of particle size d32=5.4 μm have been measured by determining the surface area of the inner flame cone and the total volumetric flow rate. It was found that in rich Al−O2−N2 mixtures, the burning velocity is a weak function of dust concentration. At the same time, the dependence of the burning velocity on the oxygen concentration is considerably stronger in rich mixtures than that reported in literature for the fuel-lean aluminum dust clouds. The burning velocity changes from 12-13 cm/s to about 32 cm/s when the oxygen content in the mixture increases from 11% to 30%. The burning velocity was also found to be a strong function of the molecular transport properties of the carrier gas. Thus, replacing the argon in an Al−O2−Ar mixture with helium increases the burning velocity from 20 to 65 cm/s. The oxygen limit for the flame propagation (9.5±0.5%) was also found by measuring the minimal oxygen concentration in the dust carrier gas when a premixed flame cone is formed inside the diffusive dust flame. A simple model of the dust flame with molecular heat transfer that has been proposed is based on the assumption that the particle burning rate in the flame front is controlled by the oxygen diffusion. It was shown that the weak dependence of the flame speed on dust concentration is a direct result of the weak dependence of the particle burning rate in the diffusive regime on the flame temperature. The model also predicts dependence of the burning velocity in rich dust mixtures on the Lewis number in accordance with the experimental observations.},

  abstract = {The majority of experimental tests done on combustible dusts are performed in constant volume vessels that have limited or no optical access. Over the years, McGill University has been developing alternative experimental techniques based on direct observation of dust flames, yielding reliable fundamental parameters such as flame burning velocity, temperature and structure. The present work describes two new experimental set-ups allowing direct observation of isobaric and freely propagating dust flames at two sufficiently different scales to test the influence of scale on dust flame phenomena. In the laboratory-scale experiments, a few grams of aluminum powder are dispersed in transparent, 30 cm diameter latex balloons that allow for full visualization of the spherical flame propagation. In the field experiments, about 1 kg of aluminum powder is dispersed by a short pulse of air, forming a conical dust cloud with a total volume of about 5 m3. High-speed digital imaging is used to record the particle dispersal and flame propagation in both configurations. In the small-scale laboratory tests, the measured flame speed is found to be about 2.0 ± 0.2 m/s in fuel-rich aluminium clouds. The burning velocity, calculated by dividing the measured flame speed by the expansion factor deduced from thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, correlates well with the previously measured burning velocity of about 22-24 cm/s from Bunsen dust flames. Flame speeds observed in field experiments with large-scale clouds, however, are found to be much higher, in the range of 12 ± 2 m/s. Estimations are presented that show that the presumably greater role of radiative heat transfer in larger-scale aluminium flames is insufficient to explain the six-fold increase in flame speed. The role of residual large-eddy turbulence, as well as the frozen-turbulence effect leading to large-scale dust concentration fluctuations that cause flame folding, are discussed as two possible sources for the greater flame speed.},

The chosen standpoint is thus a physical point of view. However, it has also been emphasised that, in order to be able to follow the details of specific models and build bridges between different subjects where new ideas related to stochastic modelling can appear, researchers must have a sound knowledge of the mathematical properties of stochastic processes. This represents a middle-of-the-road approach. Indeed, even though the subject is still relatively young, a vast mathematical literature exists on stochastic processes (Arnold, 1974; Klebaner, 1998; Oksendal, 1995; Karatzas and Shreve, 1991) but these works may not be easily accessible to physically-oriented readers. On the other hand, stochastic processes have been used in separated fields of Applied Physics but not always with a clear presentation or resorting to some ‘recipes’. Yet, in recent decades, attempts have been made to come up with improved introductions to stochastic processes in the Physics community.},

  abstract = {We present an explicit finite difference time domain method to solve the lossless Westervelt equation for a moving wave emitting boundary in one dimension and in spherical symmetry. The approach is based on a coordinate transformation between a moving physical domain and a fixed computational domain. This allows to simulate the combined effects of wave profile distortion due to the constitutive nonlinearity of the medium and the nonlinear Doppler modulation of a pressure wave due to the acceleration of the wave emitting boundary. A predictor-corrector method is employed to enhance the numerical stability of the method in the presence of shocks and grid motion. It is demonstrated that the method can accurately predict the Doppler shift of nonlinear wave distortion and the amplitude modulation caused by an oscillating motion of the wave emitting boundary. The novelty of the presented methodology lies in its capability to reflect the Doppler shift of the rate of nonlinear wave profile distortion and shock attenuation for finite amplitude acoustic waves emitted from an accelerating boundary.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a one-sided immersed boundary (IB) method using kernel functions constructed via a moving least squares (MLS) method. The resulting kernels effectively couple structural degrees of freedom to fluid variables on only one side of the fluid-structure interface. This reduces spurious feedback forcing and internal flows that are typically observed in IB models that use isotropic kernel functions to couple the structure to fluid degrees of freedom on both sides of the interface. The method developed here extends the original MLS methodology introduced by Vanella and Balaras (2009) [27]. Prior IB/MLS methods have used isotropic kernel functions that coupled fluid variables on both sides of the boundary to the interfacial degrees of freedom. The original IB/MLS approach converts the cubic spline weights typically employed in MLS reconstruction into an IB kernel function that satisfies particular discrete moment conditions. This paper shows that the same approach can be used to construct one-sided kernel functions (kernel functions are referred to as generating functions in the MLS literature). We also examine the performance of the new approach for a family of kernel functions introduced by Peskin. It is demonstrated that the one-sided MLS construction tends to generate non-monotone interpolation kernels with large over- and undershoots. We present two simple weight shifting strategies to construct generating functions that are positive and monotone, which enhances the stability of the resulting IB methodology. Benchmark cases are used to test the order of accuracy and verify the one-sided IB/MLS simulations in both two and three spatial dimensions. This new IB/MLS method is also used to simulate flow over the Ahmed car model, which highlights the applicability of this methodology for modeling complex engineering flows.},

The system under investigation is bounded by two opposite walls of set granular temperature and is characterized by zero mean flow. The comparisons between MD and theory provide evidence of higher-order effects in each of the constitutive quantities. Furthermore, the size of these effects is roughly one order of magnitude greater, on a percentage basis, for heat flux than it is for stress or dissipation rate. For the case of heat flux, these effects are attributed to super-Burnett-order contributions (third order in gradients) or greater, since Burnett-order contributions to the heat flux do not exist. Finally, for the system considered, these higher-order contributions to the heat flux outweigh the first-order contribution arising from a gradient in concentration (i.e. the Dufour effect)},

The equations must be hyperbolic in nature (although the author believes that they may also be good for some elliptic and parabolic problems). It is proven that the proposed condition was shown to be free of reflection for single wave propagation. Two severe tests were used to demonstrate the applicability of the open boundary condition: (i) the collapsing bubble, a dynamic event which excites many different internal gravity waves. The results show minimum distortion. (ii) The spatially growing K-H instability. This test differs from the previous one in that the only waves excited are those corresponding to the maximum unstable wavelengths. In this case, the maximum amplitude is reached at the open boundary. As it has been shown, the open boundary condition (2.2) produces minimum distortion.},

  abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method.},

  abstract  = {For rapidly flowing granular mixtures, existing kinetic-theory descriptions based on an assumed form of the velocity distribution function typically contain one of two simplifying assumptions: a Maxwellian velocity distribution or an equipartition of energy. In the current work, the influence of non-equipartition effects is explored in the context of two flow types: flow in which species segregation does not occur (namely, simple shear flow) and a segregating flow. For the former case, a comparison between existing kinetic theories and molecular-dynamics simulations of a binary system indicates that the incorporation of a non-Maxwellian velocity distribution is critical for reliable stress predictions, as is consistent with previous findings. However, the predictions are fairly insensitive to the equipartition versus non-equipartition treatment, despite the presence of a significant non-equipartition of energy. Nevertheless, an analysis of the diffusion equation for a segregating flow indicates that the presence of a non-equipartition of energy gives rise to additional components of the driving forces associated with size segregation. These additional components involve gradients of the species temperature, whereas theories based on an equipartition assumption only involve gradients in the mixture temperature. Molecular-dynamics simulations of the segregating flow, in conjunction with kinetic theory of binary systems, show that the non-equipartition effects are non-negligible for systems characterized by moderate values of mass differences and restitution coefficients. These simulations also reveal that the more massive particle may exhibit a lower species temperature than its lighter counterpart, contrary to previous observations in non-segregating systems. A physical explanation for this behaviour is provided.},

Its accuracy, however, is known to deteriorate as the ratio between the particle diameter (dp) and the mesh spacing (h) increases, due to the impact of the momentum that is fed back to the flow by the Lagrangian particles. Although the community typically recommends particle diameters to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the mesh spacing, the errors corresponding to a given dp/h ratio and/or flow regime have not been systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an expression to estimate the magnitude of the flow velocity disturbance resulting from the transport of a particle in the PSIC-EL framework, based on the dp/h ratio and the particle Reynolds number, Rep. This, in turn, directly relates to the error in the estimation of the undisturbed velocity, and therefore to the error in the prediction of the particle motion. We show that the upper bound of the relative error in the estimation of the undisturbed velocity, for all particle Reynolds numbers, is approximated by (6/5)dp/h. Moreover, for all cases where dp/h≲1/2, the expression we provide accurately estimates the value of the errors across a range of particle Reynolds numbers that are relevant to most gas-solid flow applications (Rep<500).},

The results are then confirmed numerically in one and two space dimensions. Simulations of two-dimensional incompressible flows with passive scalars using a classical Fourier pseudo-spectral method validate the approach for moving obstacles. The potential of the method for real world applications is illustrated by simulating a simplified dynamical mixer where for the fluid flow and the scalar transport no-slip and no-flux boundary conditions are imposed, respectively.},

It extends the volume penalization method, a member of the family of immersed boundary methods, to take into account flexible obstacles. We show how the introduction of a smoothing layer, physically interpreted as surface roughness, allows for arbitrary motion of the deformable obstacle. The approach is carefully validated and good agreement with various results in the literature is found. A simple one-dimensional solid model is derived, capable of modeling arbitrarily large deformations and imposed motion at the leading edge, as it is required for the simulation of simplified models for insect flight. The model error is shown to be small, while the one-dimensional character of the model features a reasonably easy implementation. The coupled fluid-solid interaction solver is shown not to introduce artificial energy in the numerical coupling, and validated using a widely used benchmark.

  abstract = {The influence of turbulence modeling approach by means of (U)RANS and large eddy simulation (LES) on the overall modeling of turbulent condensing wet steam flows is investigated using the example of a low-pressure steam turbine cascade. For an accurate numerical treatment of turbulence in the presence of shock waves, necessary for predictive scale-resolving computations, a hybrid flux treatment switches between a baseline nondissipative central flux in energy consistent split form and a shock-capturing upwind flux in shocked regions based on a shock sensor. Condensation is realized by a monodispersed Euler-Euler source term model, the equation of state by the highly efficient and accurate spline based table lookup method (SBTL). The numerical treatment is validated with a decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence test case containing eddy shocklets. The measurement results of the condensing wet steam cascade are overall much better matched by LES compared to RANS and URANS. Analysis shows that the LES is much better able to account for the inherently unsteady nature of the spontaneous condensation process and its interaction with the trailing edge shock wave structure.},

  abstract = {The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) represents an emerging technology aimed at exploiting lower temperature heat sources, such as waste heat in industrial processes or exhaust heat in combustion engines. One key aspect of this technology is the efficient and economical operation at part load, typically realized by a partial admission control, which is challenging to predict numerically. Full-annulus computation can only be avoided applying empirical partial admission loss models to conventional full-admission computations. This article aims at assessing the reliability of such a loss model under real-gas and supersonic conditions as a first step toward knowledge-based improved loss models. Three different operating points of an 18.3 kW ORC turbine working with an ethanol-water mixture with two open stator passages (2 × 36 deg) are considered. Full-annulus computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations are compared to experimental data and results of simulations in a conventional, full-admission, periodic 72 deg-sector model with application of a one-dimensional partial admission loss model. The experimentally obtained mass flow rate and efficiency are matched overall within their measurements accuracy. By highest inlet total pressure, the computed efficiency deviates about 4% from the experiments. Predictions of efficiency based on the full-admission and loss model correction deviate from full-annulus computations less than 1%. These findings suggest that the used empirical correlations for partial admission losses can provide acceptable results in the configuration under investigation.},

  abstract = {With the growing importance of regenerative power generation and especially of a hydrogen-based economy, the full potential of gas turbines of the smaller output class (&lt;10 MW) can be ideally exploited to provide peak coverage of the energy need whilst stabilizing the electric grids in the mid- and low-voltage range. Such machines can be typically started in a relatively short time (similarly to aero engines) and are capable, at the same time, of delivering dispatchable power-on-demand. A safe, stable and profitable operation under highly unsteady conditions poses renewed challenges for an optimal thermal management (especially in the HP stages) as well as control and surveillance of the machines. The understanding and hence predictability of the propagation of the temperature inhomogeneities originating at the combustor outlet remains hence a primary objective of current research, as persistent distortion patterns could be adopted at the turbine exhaust as diagnostic indications of a malfunction of the combustor, for example. In the present study, low-frequency disturbances introduced by a periodic load variation have been simulated and superimposed to the inhomogeneous, unsteady flow entering a three-stage, high-pressure industrial gas turbine fed by a can-type combustion chamber comprising six silo-burners. The effects of the unsteadiness realized at the combustor exit have been investigated by means of Detached Eddy Simulations, whereby a density-based solution approach with detailed thermodynamics has been employed. The periodic disturbances at the turbine inlet have been obtained by means of an artificially generated, unsteady field, resulting from a two-dimensional snapshot of the flow field at the combustor exit. Also, a combustor failure has been mimicked by reducing (respectively increasing) the mean temperature in some of the turbine inlet regions corresponding to the outlet of two burners. The propagation and amplitude changes of temperature fluctuations have been analyzed in the frequency domain. Tracking of the temperature fluctuations' maxima at the lowest frequencies revealed characteristic migration patterns indicating that the corresponding fluctuations persist with a non-negligible amplitude up to the last rows. A distinct footprint could also be observed at the same locations when a combustor failure was simulated, showing that, in principle, the early detection of combustor failures is indeed possible.},

This review summarizes several current approaches to the numerical simulation of rigid particles suspended in a flow, pointing out both common features and differences, along with their primary range of application. The focus is on non-Brownian systems for which thermal fluctuations do not play a role, whereas interparticle forces may result in particle self-assembly. Applications may include the motion of a few isolated particles with complex shape or the collective dynamics of many suspended particles.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop the discrete compatibility-constraint pressure-correction algorithm for transient simulations of variable density flows at low-Mach numbers. The constraint for the velocity field is constructed from a combination of the discrete equations of continuity and scalar (e.g. energy) transport, imposing that the newly predicted state must be compatible, in agreement with the equation of state. This way, mass and scalar conservation are guaranteed and the equation of state is exactly fulfilled at every time step. For comparison reasons, two other types of well-known pressure-correction algorithms are also used. The first class, denoted as continuity-constraint pressure-correction, is based on a constraint for the velocity field that is derived solely from the continuity equation. The second class, denoted as analytical compatibility-constraint pressure-correction, constructs the constraint from an analytical combination of the material derivative of the equation of state and the continuity and scalar equations. The algorithms are tested for three example fluid configurations: a single-fluid ideal gas, a two-fluid inert mixture and a two-fluid reacting mixture. The latter is special in the sense that the equation of state is non-linear and not everywhere differentiable. The continuity-constraint pressure-correction algorithm yields unstable solutions if density ratios are high. The analytical compatibility-constraint pressure-correction algorithm yields stable results, but the predicted states do not correspond to the equation of state. The discrete compatibility-constraint pressure-correction algorithm performs well on all test cases: the simulation results are stable and exactly match the equation of state.},

  abstract  = {A tractable solution is proposed to a classical problem in kinetic theory, namely, given any set of realizable velocity moments up to order $2n$, a closure for the moment of order $2n+1$ is constructed for which the moment system found from the free-transport term in the one-dimensional (1-D) kinetic equation is globally hyperbolic and in conservative form. In prior work, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM) was introduced to close this moment system up to fourth order ($n \le 2$). Here, HyQMOM is reformulated and extended to arbitrary even-order moments. The HyQMOM closure is defined based on the properties of the monic orthogonal polynomials $Q_n$ that are uniquely defined by the velocity moments up to order $2n-1$. Thus, HyQMOM is strictly a moment closure and does not rely on the reconstruction of a velocity distribution function with the same moments. On the boundary of moment space, $n$ double roots of the characteristic polynomial $P_{2n+1}$ of the Jacobian matrix of the system are the roots of $Q_n$, while in the interior, $P_{2n+1}$ and $Q_n$ share $n$ roots. The remaining $n+1$ roots of $P_{2n+1}$ bound and separate the roots of $Q_n$. An efficient algorithm, based on the Chebyshev algorithm, for computing the moment of order $2n+1$ from the moments up to order $2n$ is developed. The analytical solution to a 1-D Riemann problem is used to demonstrate convergence of the HyQMOM closure with increasing $n$.},

  abstract = {A quadrature-based moment method for the approximate solution of the generalized population balance equation (GPBE) governing the evolution of the joint size-velocity number density function (NDF) of a particle population is formulated and tested. The proposed method relies on the third-order hyperbolic conditional quadrature method of moments developed for velocity distribution transport. This approach is combined with the conditional quadrature method of moments to incorporate the dependency of the NDF on particle size, leading to an efficient, stable, quadrature method that uses an analytical solution to determine the size-conditioned velocity moments. The incorporation of source terms accounting for aggregation, breakup, and collisions, as well as acceleration terms such as gravity and drag, is performed using a realizable ODE solver. The approach is then demonstrated by considering zero-dimensional cases to verify the correct integration of the source terms. A set of one-dimensional cases involving droplet evaporation and coalescence is used to validate the velocity-dependent source terms. A two-dimensional case of crossing jets of particles with different sizes is used to demonstrate the proposed method in the case of a polydisperse flow with inertial particles. All work has been implemented in the open-source framework OpenQBMM, based on OpenFOAM®.},

  abstract  = {High fidelity modeling and simulation of moderately dense sprays at relatively low cost is still a major challenge for many applications. For that purpose, we introduce a new multi-fluid model based on a two-size moment formalism in sections, which are size intervals of discretization. It is derived from a Boltzmann type equation taking into account drag, evaporation and coalescence, which are representative of the complex terms that arise in multi-physics environments. The closure of the model comes from a reconstruction of the distribution. A piecewise affine reconstruction in size is thoroughly analyzed in terms of stability and accuracy, a key point for a high-fidelity and reliable description of the spray. Robust and accurate numerical methods are then developed, ensuring the realizability of the moments. The model and method are proven to describe the spray with a high accuracy in size and size-conditioned variables, resorting to a lower number of sections compared to one size moment methods. Moreover, robustness is ensured with efficient and tractable algorithms despite the numerous couplings and various algebra thanks to a tailored overall strategy. This strategy is successfully tested on a difficult 2D unsteady case, which proves the efficiency of the modeling and numerical choices.},

Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity as a function of temperature are estimated from resistivity data using the Wiedemann-Franz law. Data for liquid aluminum obtained by pulse-heating are quite rare because of the low melting temperature of aluminum with 933.47 K (660.32 °C), as the fast operating pyrometers used for the pulse-heating technique with rise times of about 100 ns generally might not be able to resolve the melting plateau of aluminum because they are not sensitive enough for such low temperature ranges. To overcome this obstacle, we constructed a new, fast pyrometer sensitive in this temperature region. Electromagnetic levitation, as the second experimental approach used, delivers data for surface tension (this quantity is not available by means of the pulse-heating technique) and for density of aluminum as a function of temperature. Data obtained will be extensively compared to existing literature data.},

Our experiments cover the axial range from the jet exit to 350 diameters downstream, and span the range of Reynolds numbers from 1500 to 20000. Flow visualizations of the scalar concentration field directly verify the presence of an underlying characteristic large-scale organization in the jet far field essentially consistent with a simplified conceptual picture proposed in an earlier study (Dahm &amp; Dimotakis 1987). High-resolution imaging measurements of successive instantaneous scalar concentration profiles in the jet support the presence of such a large-scale organization and provide details of its implications for mixing. These results also establish the proper similarity scaling for the mean concentration in the jet far field and give the scaling constant on the jet centreline as 5.4. We also present conserved scalar concentration p.d.f.s throughout the jet far field, and introduce a chemical reaction method for measuring the p.d.f.s with potentially molecular resolution. The amount of unmixed ambient fluid that reaches the jet centreline is found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number over the range investigated. The distribution of mixed fluid compositions in the concentration p.d.f. also appears to change over this range of Reynolds numbers, indicating that some aspects of large Schmidt number mixing in the jet far field have not yet become Reynolds number independent.},

Furthermore, a concept system is proposed that is potentially able to provide pressurized hydrogen and high temperature steam along with heat and work at the crankshaft. The system demonstrates high energy conversion efficiency, and it fully complies with environment sustainability requirements. The use of aluminum as an energy carrier or a fuel has been already studied in literature, but its application in the field of the energy conversion systems is currently not well explored. Once aluminum oxide layer is removed, the pure aluminum can react with water producing alumina and hydrogen while releasing a significant amount of heat that can be used to produce superheated steam. Both pressurized hydrogen and superheated steam can be used in a turbine power system developing electrical or mechanical power. Moreover, the hydrogen can be either stored for further usage or burned in order to obtain a larger amount of heat for the process. From an environmental viewpoint, an energy conversion system utilizing the combustion of aluminum with water is very interesting since the aluminum oxidation is completely greenhouse gases free and produces only hydrogen and alumina. The high grade alumina obtained by the reaction is harmless and can be employed in other technological processes or recycled back to aluminum; in this case, the closed loop use of aluminum would decrease significantly the need of new bauxite feedstock. Finally, an embodiment of the concept system for the combined production of hydrogen and power based on the aluminum combustion with water is proposed and its possible applications are discussed.},

Scrap aluminum is used for hydrogen production and the primary one is employed as an energy carrier to transport the energy from the alumina reduction system to the site of the suggested plant. The analysis focuses on the liquid aluminum injection phase immediately downstream the nozzle. High frequency thermo-cameras are employed to qualitatively assess the thermal behaviour the liquid aluminum jet. Fast imaging techniques are used to capture the multiphase flow pattern of the liquid metal jet during the injection phase. The experimental results are used to validate a 2D multi-phase CFD approach. The computational fluid dynamics model of the injection phase is created and used to extend the measurements and deepen the understanding of the thermo-fluid dynamics behaviour of the system. In particular, the influence of different nozzles diameters and different injection pressures on the liquid aluminum jet is investigated. A modular approach is adopted for the domain subdivision in order to represent accurately all the geometrical features, while the volume of fluid approach is used to model the multi-phase flow distribution in the real geometry under actual operating conditions. Finally, a good agreement between the measurements and the calculations is found.},

The cost of renewable electricity is now below the cost of hydrocarbon-generated electricity, and low enough that it is economically sensible to produce fuels using renewable electricity (Power-to-X). Aluminum is well suited to play the role of “X” in a power-to-X system. Aluminum possesses the characteristics that are most important for a sustainable energy carrier: high energy density, abundance, recyclability, and it is anticipated that the alumina-reduction process will soon be free of carbon emissions. Oxidation of aluminum yields a cycle efficiency of approximately 25% if the product(s) of oxidation are used to power a heat engine with an efficiency of 40%. This compares favourably to other proposed energy carriers, such as hydrogen and ammonia. These fuels yield cycle efficiencies of no more than 23% and 18% respectively, if the carbon-free production route is used to produce the hydrogen and ammonia.

In line with this demand, a techno-economic evaluation of aluminum as a cross-sectoral renewable energy carrier is conducted. The assessment, based on a newly developed process, involves the wet combustion of Aluminum at 700 °C resulting in heat and hydrogen (H2) generation. The designed conversion plant enables the contemporaneous generation of electricity and on demand H2 (up to 4 MW and 46.8 kg h?1) with round-trip efficiencies as high as 40.7% and full recycling of the Al2O3 waste. This study, assuming the carbon-free production of Al and three different energy cost scenarios, proves the feasibility of the e-fueling station business case. The overall energy conversion including fuel production (power-to-Al), utilization (Al-to-power and Al-to-H2), and recycling requires a capital investment of 5200 ? per kW installed power without additional primary material demand. Hence, the estimated power-to-X cost for the Al-based H2 is estimated in the range of 4.2?9.6 ? kg?1 H2, while wind and solar power based green H2 production cost varies from 6.5 to 12.1 ? kg?1 H2.},

  abstract = {Reaction of aluminum with water is of interest for hydrogen generation for a wide range of applications, from in-situ operated fuel cells to propulsion of underwater vehicles. Despite extensive studies, detailed reaction mechanisms are lacking and the locations of the reaction interface between aluminum and liquid water or steam are not identified. In this work, the reaction interfaces are located by interpreting heat flow calorimetry and thermo-gravimetry data for liquid water and steam, respectively. In both experiments, two spherical aluminum powders are used with different but overlapping particle size distributions. The measured reaction rate is assumed to be proportional to the surface area of the reaction interface; thus the measured heat flow and weight gain are partitioned among particles based on their size distribution. The data are processed considering several reaction models assuming different locations of the reaction interface: inside or outside of the growing Al2O3 or Al(OH)3 shells. It is expected that if the correct interface location is selected, the oxidation of the particles with the same sizes and exposed to the same temperature/environment but belonging to different powders will be identical to each other. For liquid water, results suggest that the reaction occurs at the surface of the shrinking aluminum core, inside the growing aluminum hydroxide layer. For reactions of aluminum with steam at elevated temperatures, the results are less conclusive, but indicate that the reaction is most likely occurring at the outer surface of the growing alumina shell. The growing alumina shell is rigid and is fractured multiple times during its growth. After a shell is fractured, a new shell begins to grow around the oxidizing aluminum core.},

  abstract = {In the US, the total amount of aluminum scrap and waste, including foil, is outpacing efforts to recycle it into conventional aluminum materials. It would be attractive to develop technologies for converting aluminum foil scrap and waste to useful products and energy carriers. The present paper focuses on the feasibility of converting foil to activated Al powders that chemically split water, releasing hydrogen. As a method for this conversion, high-energy ball milling of Al foil with sodium chloride is investigated, with removing NaCl from the obtained powder by dissolution in cold water or methanol. The powders are characterized using BET specific surface area analysis, laser diffraction particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The obtained micron-sized Al powders readily react with warm (35-80°C) water. Hydrogen evolution is studied using water displacement, while solid byproducts are examined by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. The powders are also mixed with gelled water at various mass ratios and combustion of these mixtures is studied in argon environment. With increasing Al concentration, the combustion front velocity increases despite the decrease in the combustion temperature. The burning rate of the stoichiometric mixture of the activated Al powder with water is comparable with the values reported previously for the mixtures based on nanoscale aluminum, while the content of active Al in the obtained micron-sized powder is significantly higher.},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the design of the experimental apparatus aimed at analyzing the performance of the combustion chamber of a cogeneration system based on the reaction of liquid aluminum and water steam. The cogeneration system exploits the heat released by the oxidation of aluminum with water for super-heating the vapor of a steam cycle and simultaneously producing hydrogen. The only by-product is alumina, which in a closed loop can be recycled back and transformed again into aluminum. Therefore, aluminum is used as an energy carrier to transport the energy from the alumina reduction plant to the location of the proposed system. The water is also used in a closed loop since the amount of water produced employing the hydrogen obtained by the proposed system corresponds to the oxidizing water for the Al/H2O reaction. This study investigates the combustor where the liquid aluminum-steam reaction takes place. In particular, the design of the combustion chamber and the interaction between the liquid aluminum jet and the water steam flow are evaluated using a numerical and an experimental approach. The test rig is specifically designed for the analysis of the liquid aluminum injection in a slightly super-heated steam stream. The first experiments are carried out to verify the correct behavior of the test rig. Thermography is employed to qualitatively assess the steam entrainment of the liquid aluminum jet. Finally, the experimental measurements are compared with the multi-dimension multi-phase flow simulations in order to estimate the influence of varying operating conditions on the reaction behavior. Further analysis will concern experiments aimed at investigating the reaction efficiency for different aluminum and water steam mass flow rates as well as the effects of the relative fuel/oxidizer speeds.},

  abstract = {Metals are energy-dense fuels that can react exothermically with water to produce hydrogen, and this hydrogen is useful as a propellant for rockets and underwater vehicles or as a fuel for engines and fuel cells. Propulsion systems usually rely on high-temperature combustion (T>3000K) of metal-water propellants, while hydrogen-production systems typically employ low reactor temperatures (T<100°C). This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of both low-temperature and high-temperature metal-water reactions. Low-temperature reactions allow only the chemical energy contained in the hydrogen to be used, with the thermal energy released during the metal-water reaction being wasted. Metal-water propulsion systems typically make use of only the thermal energy of the metal-water reaction, with the hydrogen being exhausted to produce thrust. This paper proposes several novel applications of high-temperature metal-water combustion that allow the full chemical energy within the metal fuel to be harnessed, including high-speed air-breathing engines and high-power, compact, low-emissions power-generation systems. These technologies promise improved performance by maximizing the conversion of the chemical energy, stored within the metal fuel, into useful work at sufficient rates for high-power applications.},

  abstract = {The continuous increase in primary energy demand and the decrease in the availability of fossil fuels were led to a condition of energy security concerns. In this context, hydrogen can be seen as a promising energy carriers. This paper investigated the environmental performance, through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, of a combined production system of hydrogen and power based on aluminum combustion with water. This system is potentially able to produce the integrated generation of four energy sources: hydrogen, high temperature steam, heat and work at the turbine shaft. The LCA results indicated that the life-cycle phases that determine the main environmental impact are: liquid aluminum production, transports of liquid aluminum and electricity consumption. In addition, the major release of carbon dioxide emissions is due to the use of natural gas in the aluminum production phase. In order to determine the “greener” alternative and support the system design choices, according to the eco-design perspective, different system configurations were investigated. In particular, the reaction mechanism between first primary aluminum powder and water steam and then secondary aluminum at liquid state and water steam. The environmental comparison highlighted that the former layout increases by more than 78% compared to latter one.},

  abstract  = {Summary Water displacement method is used to study the influence of temperatures (60?80°C), additives (Na2CO3, NaCl, Na2CO3/NaCl) and concentrations on the reaction characteristics and kinetics of Al?H2O. Results show that the reaction rate and the hydrogen yield are enhanced with the increase of the temperature or by adding Na2CO3. The reaction rate is decreased by adding NaCl, but which has less effect on the hydrogen yield. For the mixture additive, Na2CO3 plays a key role in improving the hydrogen yield and the reaction rate. The influence degree of different factors is analyzed by orthogonal method. The most obvious factor is additive, but additive concentration has a minimum influence. The solid products are collected and analyzed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Al, Al(OH)3 and AlO(OH) are detected. The spherical particles are obviously found at the initial reaction stage. However, they change to flocs at the end of reaction. Kinetic analysis shows that the reaction mechanism of Al?H2O is changed by adding Na2CO3 or mixture, but it is not affected by adding NaCl. Moreover, the apparent activation energy of Al?H2O is 74.49 kJ mol?1, while it is only 43.03 kJ mol?1 for Al?H2O with 5 wt% Na2CO3 addition. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {A number of processes such as laser ablation, laser welding, electric discharge machining, etc involve high temperatures. Most of the processes involve temperatures much higher than the target melting and normal boiling point. Such large variation in target temperature causes a significant variation in its material properties. Due to the unavailability of experimental data on material properties at elevated temperatures, usually the data at lower temperatures is often erroneously extrapolated during modelling of these processes. Therefore, this paper attempts to evaluate the variation in material properties with temperature using some general and empirical theories, along with the available experimental data for aluminum. The evaluated properties of Al using the proposed models show a significant variation with temperature. Between room temperature and near-critical temperature (0.9Tc), surface reflectivity of Al varies from more than 90% to less than 50%, absorption coefficient decreases by a factor of 7, thermal conductivity decreases by a factor of 5, density decreases by a factor of 4, specific heat and latent heat of vapourization vary by a factor between 1.5 and 2. Applying these temperature-dependent material properties for modelling laser ablation suggest that optical properties have a greater influence on the process than thermophysical properties. The numerical predictions of the phase explosion threshold in laser ablation are within 5% of the experimental values.},

  abstract  = {This review is devoted to the study of ultrafast laser ablation of solids and liquids. The ablation of condensed matter under exposure to subpicosecond laser pulses has a number of peculiar properties which distinguish this process from ablation induced by nanosecond and longer laser pulses. The process of ultrafast ablation includes light absorption by electrons in the skin layer, energy transfer from the skin layer to target interior by nonlinear electronic heat conduction, relaxation of the electron and ion temperatures, ultrafast melting, hydrodynamic expansion of heated matter accompanied by the formation of metastable states and subsequent formation of breaks in condensed matter. In case of ultrashort laser excitation, these processes are temporally separated and can thus be studied separately. As for energy absorption, we consider peculiarities of the case of metal irradiation in contrast to dielectrics and semiconductors. We discuss the energy dissipation processes of electronic thermal wave and lattice heating. Different types of phase transitions after ultrashort laser pulse irradiation as melting, vaporization or transitions to warm dense matter are discussed. Also nonthermal phase transitions, directly caused by the electronic excitation before considerable lattice heating, are considered. The final material removal occurs from the physical point of view as expansion of heated matter; here we discuss approaches of hydrodynamics, as well as molecular dynamic simulations directly following the atomic movements. Hybrid approaches tracing the dynamics of excited electrons, energy dissipation and structural dynamics in a combined simulation are reviewed as well.},

Vacuum expansion is found to quench the ejected material 1-3 orders of magnitude more efficiently than thermal conduction quenches the residual bulk surface. Efficient quenching implies that solid-phase particles are produced rapidly (in ≪1 ns) following laser excitation; this may allow unique material states to be frozen within the ejected particles. Finally, the mean particle size is estimated to range from ∼1 to ∼10 nm for initial lattice temperatures ranging from 0.3 to 10 eV.},

However, at high fluences, when the target is heated close to its critical temperature, phase explosion also occurs due to homogeneous nucleation.

In this paper, a model of laser ablation is presented that considers vaporization and phase explosion as mechanisms of material removal and also accounts for the variation in material properties up to critical temperature using some general and empirical theories. In addition, plasma shielding due to inverse bremsstrahlung and photo-ionization is considered. The model predicts accurately (within 5 %) the phase explosion threshold fluence of Al. The predictions of ablation depth by the model are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements at low fluences. Whereas, the degree of error marginally increases at high laser fluences.},

  abstract = {Ignition of iron particles in an oxidizing environment marks the onset of self-sustained combustion. The objective of the current study is to quantitatively examine the ignition characteristics of fine iron particles (i.e., 1µm- to 100µm-sized) governed by the kinetics of solid-phase iron oxidation. The oxidation rates are inversely proportional to the thickness of the oxide layer (i.e., following a parabolic rate law) and calibrated using the experimentally measured growth of iron-oxide layers over time. Steady-state (i.e., Semenov’s analysis) and unsteady analysis have been performed to probe the dependence of the critical gas temperature required to trigger a thermal runaway (namely, the ignition temperature Tign) on particle size, initial thickness of oxide layer, inert gas species, radiative heat loss, and the collective heating effect in a suspension of particles. Both analyses indicate that Tign depends on δ0, i.e., the ratio between the initial oxide layer thickness and particle size, regardless of the absolute size of the particle. The unsteady analysis predicts that, for δ0≲0.003, Tign becomes independent of δ0. Under standard conditions in air, Tign is approximately 1080 K for any particle size greater than 5µm. The ignition temperature decreases as the thermal conductivity of the oxidizing gas decreases. Radiative heat loss has a minor effect on Tign. The collective effect of a suspension of iron particles in reducing Tign is demonstrated. The transition behavior between kinetic-controlled and external-diffusion-controlled combustion regimes of an ignited iron particle is systematically examined. The influences of initial oxide-layer thickness and particle temperature on the ignition delay time, τign, of iron particles are parametrically probed. A d2-law scaling between τign and particle size is identified. Possible sources of inaccuracy are discussed.},

  abstract = {A numerical study of the effects of transients and variable properties on single droplet evaporation into an infinite stagnant gas is presented. Sample calculations are reported for octane droplets, initially at 300°K with Ro = 0·1, 0·5, 2·5 × 10−4m, evaporating into air at temperatures and pressures in the ranges 600-2000°K and 1-10 atm, respectively. It is found that initial size Ro is eliminated from the problem on scaling time with respect to R20 and that the evaporative process becomes quasi-steady with (RR0)2 = (R∗0R0)2−βtR20, as suggested by experiment. Comparisons of solutions using various reference property schemes with those for variable properties show that best agreement obtains using a simple 13 rule wherein properties are evaluated at Tr = Ts + (Te−Ts)3 and m1,r = m1,s + (m1,e− m1,s)3. The effects of temporal storage of mass species, energy, etc. and radial pressure variations in the vapor phase prove to be negligible, the early transient behavior being solely due to sensible heat effects within the droplet and related variations in vapor-side driving forces. Résumé On présente une étude numérique des effets de la période transitoire et des propriétés variables sur l'évaporation d'une gouttelette unique dans un gaz infini au repos. Des exemples de calculs sont présentés pour des gouttelettes d'octane initialement à 300k avec R0 = 0,1−0,5−2,5.10−4m s'évaporant dans l'air à des températures et des pressions respectivement dans les domaines 600-2000 K et 1-10 atm. On trouve que la dimension initiale R0 n'intervient plus dans le problème lorsque l'échelle de temps est rapportée à R20 et que le processus d'évaporation devient quasi-stationnaire lorsque (RR0)2 = (R+0R0)2 − βtR20, comme le suggère l'expérience. Les comparaisons des solutions utilisant des combinaisons variées de propriétés de référence avec celles à propriétés variables montrent que le meilleur accord s'obtient en utilisant une loi simple 1,3 dans laquelle les propriétés sont évaluées à Tr = Ts + (Te− Ts)3 et ml,r = ml,s + (ml,e−ml,s)3. Les effets de mise en mémoire temporaire des espèces massiques, de l'énergie, etc. et des variations radiales de pression dans la phase vapeur se sont avérés négligeables, la première évolution transitoire étant seulement dûe aux effets de chauffage sensibles dans la gouttelette et aux variations qui s'y rattachent des forces actives du côté vapeur. Zusammenfassung Es wird eine rechnerische Untersuchung der Einflüsse von instationären und veränderlichen Stoffeigenschaften auf die Verdampfung eines einzelnen Tropfens in ein unbegrenztes ruhendes Gas vorgelegt. Es wird ein Beispiel gerechnet für Oktan-Tropfen, die bei einer Anfangstemperatur von 300 K mit R0 = 0,1; 0,5; 2,5 × 10−4m in Luft verdampfen, die im Temperatur- und Druckbereich von 600 und 2000 K sowie 1 bzw. 10 atm vorliegt. Es wurde festgestellt, daβ der Anfangsdurchmesser R0 eliminiert wird durch den Zeitmaβstab unter Berücksichtigung von R20, und daβ, wie das Experiment zeigt, der Verdampfungsprozeβ quasistationär wird mit (RR20) = (R∗0R0)2−βtR20. Der Vergleich einer Lösung, die sich bei verschiedenen Bezugsstoffeigenschaften ergeben hat, mit einer, die für veränderliche Stoffeigenschaften erhalten wurde, zeigt, daβ sich die beste Übereinstimmung ergibt, wenn eine einfache 13 verwendet wird, wobei die Stoffeigenschaften bei der Temperatur Tr = Ts + (Te−Ts)3 und dem Massenanteil m1,r = m1,s + (m1,e− m1,s)3 berechnet werden. Des Einfluβ der zeitlichen Speicherung von Massengröβen. Energie usw. sowie von radialen Druckschwankungen in der Dampfphase erweist sich als vernachlässigbar. Das anfänglich instationäre Verhalten beruht allein auf dem Einfluβ der fühlbaren Wärme im Tropfen und damit verknüpften Veränderungen in den treibenden Kräften der Dampfseite.

The boundary conditions at the solid particle surface, such as velocity, temperature, density, and chemical species concentration, are well enforced through the present method. Two semiglobal heterogeneous reactions and one homogeneous reaction are used to describe the chemical reactions in the domain, and the Stefan flow caused by the heterogeneous reactions is considered. A satisfactory agreement can be found between the present simulation results and experimental data in the literature. The method is then used to investigate the combustion property of a char particle and the interaction between CO2 gasification and O2 oxidation.

  abstract = {This paper critically reviews the theoretical and experimental literature regarding the fundamental aspects of flames in nonvolatile solid fuel suspensions. Unlike volatile fuels that form continuous premixed gaseous flame sheets, flame fronts in nonvolatile suspensions are driven by heterogeneous reactions localized on the surface, or near the surface, of individual particles. Practically all peculiarities of heterogeneous flames can be linked to this “flame-inside-the-flame” combustion front structure. These localized reactions enable particles to self-heat and transition from kinetically to diffusion-limited heterogeneous reaction during the process of particle ignition. After ignition, burning particles behave as individual diffusion micro-reactors that are insensitive to the bulk gas temperature and overall heat loss from the system. Relatively small quenching distances of the flame in suspensions, long plateaus in the dependence of burning velocity on fuel concentration stretching to very fuel-rich mixtures, and the discrete flame propagation regime, where burning velocity is insensitive to particle combustion time and the flame-front structure is rough and nonuniform, are all manifestations of particle ignition and combustion in the diffusion-limited regime. This review summarizes the key experimental evidence of laminar flame structure and flame speed from a variety of experimental apparatus both in the laboratory and under microgravity conditions, and interprets these results in terms of relatively simple theoretical models. Heterogeneous flames are observed to exhibit many of the thermodiffusive and hydrodynamic instabilities of homogeneous flames, as well as several new instabilities that arise from the multiphase nature of the fuel and particle ignition and extinction. Flames of binary mixtures of heterogeneous fuels, or gaseous and solid fuel mixtures, are also reviewed and it is shown that a simple model based on matching the flame speed between thermally interacting fronts can capture the key physics. Finally, the last chapter of the review discusses why the important or even crucial role of radiation heat transfer predicted by theoretical models for flames in suspensions is not supported by the available experimental evidence. It is argued that large spatial scales of radiation heat transfer do not permit separation of the radiation transfer problem from boundary conditions and flow configuration, making one-dimensional flame models that include radiation inadequate for the description of flames in the laboratory and even in relatively large unconfined dust clouds.},

  abstract = {As a result of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), several countries committed to phasing down coal electricity as soon as possible, deactivating hundreds of power plants in the near future. CO2-free electricity can be generated in these plants by retrofitting them for iron combustion. Iron oxides produced during the process can be collected and reduced back to metallic iron using H2, in a circular process where it becomes an energy carrier. Using clean energy in the recycling process enables storage and distribution of excess generated in periods of abundance. This concept uses and scales up existing dry metal cycle technologies, which are the focus of extensive research worldwide. Retrofitting is evaluated here to determine feasibility of adding these material requirements to markets, in the context of current plans for decarbonization of steel industry, and policies on hydrogen and renewable electricity. Results indicate that not only for a single power plant, but also on larger scales, the retrofitting plan is viable, promoting and supporting advancements in sustainable electricity, steel industry and hydrogen production, converging necessary technological and construction efforts. The maturation and first commercial-scale application of iron combustion technology by 2030, together with developing necessary reduction infrastructure over the next decades, would pave the way for large-scale retrofitting and support the phasing out of coal in many regions. The proposed plan represents a feasible solution that takes advantage of existing assets, creates a long-lasting legacy for the industry and establishes circular energy economies that increase local energy security.},

  abstract = {The combustion behavior of single laser-ignited iron particles is investigated. Transient particle radiant intensities at 850 nm and 950 nm are measured by post-processing recorded high-speed camera images using an in-house developed particle tracking program. Then, the time-resolved particle temperature is obtained based on two-color pyrometry. A plateau-like stage shortly after the ignition is repeatedly observed, and identified as iron particle melting by the measured temperature and the estimated melting time. Besides, an abrupt brightness jump near the end of combustion is observed for most burning particles, while a small portion of the particles (< 10%) show a second plateau-like stage instead. The particle temperature right after the brightness jump (1880±70 K) is almost identical to that during the second plateau-like stage. This temperature corresponds to two phase-change temperatures in the Fe-O phase diagram: i) L2 <=> Fe3O4 (s) at 1869 K (congruent melting) and ii) L2 <=> Fe3O4 (s) + O2 (g) at 1855 K (eutectic reaction), where L2 represents a liquid iron oxide. Based on this, the presence of the brightness jump (spear point) is explained by a sudden solidification of supercooled iron oxide droplets with an atomic O/Fe ratio larger than or close to 4/3. Particles’ near-peak temperatures are also measured based on time-integrated spectra. The results indicate that the near-peak temperature increases first fast and then slowly with an increase of oxygen concentration. At higher oxygen concentrations, smaller particles have a slightly lower temperature. The effect of particle size on the near-peak temperature is negligible at lower oxygen concentrations due to weaker radiation. The morphology of combusted particles is examined by micrography. Some burned particles appear as hollow thin-shell spheres at all adopted oxygen concentrations. Additionally, nano oxides are found at 13-51% oxygen concentrations. Less traces of nano oxides were observed at reduced oxygen concentrations. The nano-oxide formation mechanisms are analyzed based on thermochemical equilibrium calculations.},

The combustion of iron powders seems very promising in this regard. Yet, little is known about their in-process morphological and microstructural evolution, which are critical features for the circularity of the concept, especially the subsequent reduction of the combusted oxide powders back to iron. Here, we investigated two iron powder combustion pathways, one in air and one with the assistance of a propane pilot flame. Both processes resulted in spherical hollow particles composed of a complex microstructure of wüstite, magnetite and/or hematite. Partial evaporation is indicated by the observation of nanoparticles on the micro-sized combustion products. The associated gas production inside the liquid droplet could be the origin of the internal porosity and micro-explosion events. Cracking at the end of the combustion process results in mostly open porosity, which is favorable for the subsequent reduction process. With this study, we aim to open the perspective of iron metal fuel from macroscopic combustion analysis towards a better understanding of the underlying microscopic thermodynamic, kinetic, microstructural and thermomechanical mechanisms.},

The model only considers the gas phase and includes a reduced Al/O2 kinetic scheme with 8 species and 10 reactions. The model is validated against experimental burn time data and appears to be fairly correct despite its simplicity. The unsteady combustion is then investigated by superimposing an acoustic disturbance to the mean flow. The velocity-coupled response is computed for different frequencies and slip Reynolds numbers. A resonance peak is found to occur when the acoustic time scale matches the gas diffusion time scale. For lower frequencies however (typically below a few kHz), a quasi-steady regime seems to hold out which means that assuming quasi-steady combustion (e.g., given by a D2 model) is valid in this case. In this regime, the computed response corresponds with a theoretical expression obtained by a linearization of the Ranz-Marshall correction term. This implies that unsteady aluminum combustion is strongly dependent on convection effects.},

  abstract = {In order to explore the law of single aluminum droplet evaporation process in argon, based on the VOF method, this paper carried out a corresponding two-dimensional transient multiphase flow numerical simulation. The evaporation process of droplet behavior in forced convection environment is compared and analyzed, and the influences of gas velocity on evaporation rate, the change of the droplet temperature and concentration boundary layer, and the variation of the velocity field around the droplet are studied. The research results showed that droplet evaporation can be divided into transient variation period and steady-state period. As the gas velocity increased from 2 m/s to 5 m/s, the evaporation rate at the transient variation period of aluminum droplets was increased by 22%-36%, and the evaporation rate at the steady-state stage was increased by 16%-33%; At 2 m/s, the temperature boundary layer on the windward and leeward sides of the droplet was thicker than the concentration boundary layer, indicating that the temperature diffusion was greater than the concentration diffusion; In addition, when the airflow around the droplet, the double row of vortices periodically fell off from the upper and lower sides of the droplet with opposite rotation direction and regular arrangement. With the mutual interference and influence between shedding vortices, Karman vortex street was formed, and the formation of the Karman vortex street became more obvious with the increase of the Reynolds number.

  abstract = {We present a numerical study of the combustion of single iron particles in an O2-N2 atmosphere. By resolving the full boundary layer, mass and heat transfer are accurately modeled, including Stefan flow. Only the conversion of Fe to FeO is taken into account and evaporation is implemented to investigate the formation of nano-sized iron-oxides products. Temperature- and composition-dependent heat capacity and density are used and phase transitions from solid to liquid (and vice-versa) are accounted for by the apparent heat capacity method. The model is validated by comparing the time to maximum temperature (tmax) and the maximum temperature (Tmax) of a 40 and 50 µm particle in an O2-N2 atmosphere with experiments. The current model, which assumes infinitely fast internal transport, can well estimate the maximum particle temperature and the time to reach this maximum temperature, but it does not capture the particle size effect on the maximum temperature. Even though the particle temperature stays below its boiling temperature, a small but non-negligible amount of mass is lost due to evaporation of the particle. Evaporation of the particle and oxidization of the gaseous Fe-containing species in the boundary layer limit the maximum temperature of the particle when increasing the oxygen concentration. By means of a sectional model, the formation and growth of the iron oxide nano-particles is numerically investigated. It is shown that somewhat further downstream of the particle, the volume fraction of nano-particles attains a maximum. An average nano-particle diameter of 40 nm is found at t/tmax=1 in the wake of a 50 µm iron particle burning at 21% oxygen concentration.},

The gas-phase model includes both species transport and energy conservation equations. Moreover, expansion of the gas-phase, including particle slip velocity, is taken into account. Gas-phase properties are realistically dependent on temperature and composition. The particle model includes both the transport of oxidizer and surface kinetics. Lastly, a consistent formulation is used for the exchange of mass between the phases. When the particle conversion rate is diffusion-limited, the burning velocity is found to be dependent on local oxygen concentration. Moreover, the effect is sufficiently strong, such that the maximum burning velocity is found at fuel-lean conditions. This demonstrates that both energy and species transport equations in the gas phase and dispersed phase equations must be solved together.},

  abstract = {Aluminum(Al) powder has been proposed as a promising dense energy carrier to store and transport abundant renewable power for a future carbon-neutral society. In this work, a detailed model for simulating Al particle cloud combustion with multiple oxidizers in the context of large eddy simulation is developed. The Al particles are tracked in the lagrangian framework with various sub-models including phase change, heterogeneous surface reaction, evaporation and radiation. The model is then employed to simulate turbulent jet flames with Al particles(d32=25 μm) in a hot co-flow. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy(TDLAS) is used to measure the temperature and H2O distribution. The present model is first validated by comparing the predicted condensed Al2O3 distribution with the measured Mie scattering signals. The results indicate that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Further comparisons of the temperature and H2O profile are then conducted. The numerical simulation predicts weaker mass and heat transport in the upstream and middle of the flame along the centerline of the burner, compared with the reconstructed TDLAS results, but the downstream scalar profiles of the jet flame agree well with the measurements. Discrete characteristics are observed in the simulated instantaneous temperature and condensed Al2O3 snapshots, which are due to the nature of heterogeneous combustion of metal fuel particles under fuel-lean conditions. Finally, the influence of the oxidizer mole fraction and the initial temperature of the primary jet on the ignition distance is analyzed. The results demonstrate that the ignition distance can be decreased effectively by increasing the oxidizer concentration of the hot co-flow or the initial temperature of the Al particles and carrier gas.},

  abstract = {A numerical model for aluminum cloud combustion which includes the effects of interphase heat transfer, phase change, heterogeneous surface reactions, homogeneous combustion, oxide cap growth and radiation within the Euler-Lagrange framework is proposed. The model is validated in single particle configurations with varying particle diameters. The combustion process of a single aluminum particle is analyzed in detail and the particle consumption rates as well as the heat release rates due to the various physical/chemical sub-models are presented. The combustion time of single aluminum particles predicted by the model are in very good agreement with empirical correlations for particles with diameters larger than 10 μm. The prediction error for smaller particles is noticeably reduced when using a heat transfer model that is capable of capturing the transition regime between continuum mechanics and molecular dynamics. The predictive capabilities of the proposed model framework are further evaluated by simulating the aluminum/air Bunsen flames of McGill University for the first time. Results show that the predicted temperature distribution of the flame is consistent with the experimental data and the double-front structure of the Bunsen flame is reproduced well. The burning rates of aluminum in both single particle and particle cloud configurations are calculated and compared with empirical correlations. Results show that the burning rates obtained from the present model are more reasonable, while the correlations, when embedded in the Euler-Lagrange context, tend to underestimate the burning rate in the combustion stage, particularly for the considered fuel-rich flames.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange modelling of dilute particle-laden flows, with arbitrary particle-size to mesh-spacing ratio. Two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange methods classically require particles to be much smaller than the computational mesh cells for them to be accurately tracked. Particles that do not satisfy this requirement can be considered by introducing a source term regularisation operator that typically consists in convoluting the point-wise particle momentum sources with a smooth kernel. Particles that are larger than the mesh cells, however, generate a significant local flow disturbance, which, in turn, results in poor estimates of the fluid forces acting on them. To circumvent this issue, this paper proposes a new framework to recover the local undisturbed velocity at the location of a given particle, that is the local flow velocity from which the disturbance due to the presence of the particle is subtracted. It relies upon the solution of the Stokes flow through a regularised momentum source and is extended to finite Reynolds numbers based on the Oseen flow solution. Owing to the polynomial nature of the regularisation kernel considered in this paper, a correction for the averaged local flow disturbance can be analytically derived, allowing to filter out scales of the flow motion that are smaller than the particle, which should not be taken into account to compute the interaction/drag forces acting on the particle. The proposed correction scheme is applied to the simulation of a particle settling under the influence of gravity, for varying particle-size to mesh-spacing ratios and varying Reynolds numbers. The method is shown to nearly eliminate any impact of the underlying mesh resolution on the modelling of a particle's trajectory. Finally, optimal values for the scale of the regularisation kernel are provided and their impact on the flow is discussed.},

DEM allows the numerical simulation of the moving and reacting limestone bed in the kiln and is coupled with a 3-dimensional CFD simulation describing the interstitial gas phase. A PFR-kiln consists of two vertical shafts and a connecting crossover channel. The two shafts periodically switch their function at regular intervals of about 15 min. While one shaft calcines the product in parallel flow with gas temperatures above 900 °C, the other preheats the stones in counter flow. The model has been applied to an industrial PFR-kiln of 18 m height. A realistic particle size distribution of the limestone with particles ranging from 50 to 90 mm has been set. Methane combustion provides the heat for calcination and is simulated by a two-step mechanism. Simulation results show a nearly uniform temperature distribution in the calcination zone but significant inner particle temperature gradients. The calcination degree depends on the particle location within the kiln and decreases towards the outer kiln walls. Measured and simulated temperatures are compared. Maximum temperature values as well as its characteristic oscillation induced by the periodic kiln operation could be reproduced by the simulation, especially keeping in mind the difficulties of thermocouple measurements under the harsh conditions in industrial reality.},

  abstract = {In lime shaft kilns the limestone is heated in counterflow with the flue gas from multiple burners, commonly fired by fossil or alternative fuels. After preheating, the limestone enters the calcination zone with gas temperatures above approximately 900°C. To achieve high thermal efficiencies and calcination degrees, a homogeneous gas flow through the packed bed is essential. Spatial pressure differences and energy sinks and sources resulting from the calcination process and the fuel combustion make it even more difficult to predict the actual three-dimensional temperature and flow distribution in the kiln. Furthermore the particle size distribution is important for the system design, because limestone with larger size needs significantly higher residence time in the calcination zone for full conversion. This work presents the application of a novel 3-dimensional particle-mechanics based, numerical tool on an industrial scale. The tool allows the simulation of a moving and reacting limestone bed in a shaft kiln coupled with the 3-dimensional CFD-simulation describing the interstitial gas phase. Convective heat transfer between gas phase and particles, radiative and contact heat transfer between particles as well as calcination reaction are accounted for. With this combined approach the calcination of the limestone bed can be simultaneously described on the system scale while resolving detailed thermo-chemical processes on the particle scale.},
