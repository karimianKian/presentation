  abstract = {Nanoparticle production using microemulsion droplets has become a
	very interesting technique in the recent years. It allows a controlled
	adjustment of the particle size, which is an essential task due to
	the highly size-dependent properties of nanoparticles. For numerical
	investigations of this configuration a population balance model (PBM)
	framework based on discrete coordinates has been derived. An appropriate
	reduction concept is applied to obtain an efficient numerical solution.
	Although the resulting zero-dimensional (spatially homogeneous) calculations
	show a qualitatively good agreement with the experimental data for
	stoichiometric conditions, larger deviations have been observed for
	cases with a high concentration excess of one reactant inside the
	microemulsion droplets. Such deviations might result from the fact
	that the precipitation rate strongly depends on the local supersaturation.
	High concentration differences, especially near the feed lead to
	large local variations of the supersaturation profile. Thus, computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been performed for a refined
	analysis. This has been managed by implementing the reduced PBM model
	in the commercial CFD code FLUENT® 6.2 via user-defined scalars and
	functions. By this way, it becomes possible to investigate the reaction
	process for various three-dimensional inhomogeneous hydrodynamic
	conditions with acceptable computational times. The obtained results
	are finally compared with the homogeneous calculation results and
	with the experiments. Moreover, local variations within the reactor
	are also examined.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the crystallization of BaSO 4 in turbulent flows
	using numerical simulations, since many questions are still open
	for this important process. The corresponding calculations are performed
	both for steady state and for time-dependent conditions, for homogeneous
	as well as for mixing-controlled flows. The employed kinetic model
	has been coupled with a standard method of moments using the first
	four moments in order to compute the evolution of the crystal population.
	Assuming a prescribed function shape, for example a Gaussian, this
	further allows to depict the crystal size distribution (CSD) as a
	function of time or of the spatial position in the crystallization
	reactor. Time-dependent simulations in a homogeneous flow are first
	validated by comparison with the exact solution of the corresponding
	full reaction kinetic model. After this successful validation, steady-state
	calculations are performed for a coaxial pipe mixer using two different
	reference problems available in the literature. The quality of the
	employed numerical model is first checked by comparing with experimental
	results from Marchisio et al. (American Institute of Chemical Engineers
	Journal 48, 2039-2050). Further simulations are then carried out
	for a second mixing problem (configuration of Wei and Garside (Chemical
	Engineering Research &amp; Design 75(A2), 219-227)), for which numerical
	results are available. For this second case, since the numerical
	methods and physical models used in the present work have been noticeably
	improved compared to the original publication (finer grid, higher
	level of convergence, more accurate computation of the activity coefficient
	… ), considerable differences in the findings are observed. Nevertheless,
	the coupling of a Computational Fluid Dynamics code (here Fluent
	6.1) with the standard method of moments using User-Defined Functions
	and Scalars, followed by an extensive post-processing of the results
	leads to a detailed prediction of the obtained CSD for crystallization
	processes in non-homogeneous turbulent flows.},

	The morphological properties of soot and the particlesize distribution

  abstract = {Barium sulphate precipitation, widely used to validate micromixing
	models, requires the knowledge of nucleation and crystal growth kinetics
	under non stoichiometric conditions, which is generally the case
	when two fluids are mixed. Therefore, the spontaneous precipitation
	of barium sulphate was studied under both stoichiometric and non
	stoichiometric conditions. A new method was developed to derive the
	nucleation and crystal growth rates based on the simultaneous measurement
	of concentration and crystal size distribution. Two expressions were
	proposed describing well nucleation and crystal growth kinetics.
	The kinetic parameters were determined as a function of the initial
	concentration ratio, showing the crucial effect of stoichiometry
	on the nucleation and crystal growth kinetics. Consequently, attention
	should be paid to the use of kinetic laws of barium sulphate precipitation
	to validate micromixing models.},

  abstract  = {In this contribution we deal with a critical problem in the numerical
	modelling of the dispersed phase flow systems using population balances.
	To solve this problem, we derived a Meshless Moving Particle Method
	(MMPM) which is based on coupling information and function approximation
	theories to recover the complete particle size distribution in a
	grid free environment. The particles, which adapt their positions
	according to population integral properties, are allowed to propagate
	using a few number of ODEs. These particle positions are found exactly
	the same as those predicted by the Chebyshev-QMOM; however, without
	iterative eigenvalue calculations. The overall complexity of the
	method is O(N) where N is the number of moving particles. The MMPM
	is validated using many test cases with known analytical solutions
	including microbial cell dynamics in a constant abiotic environment.
	The sequence of the continuous approximations of the number concentration
	function is found to converge with an order O(1/Nc) with c > 1.},

  abstract = {Erosion of apparatus surfaces resulting from cavitation has been for
	a long time an important technological and research problem in the
	fields utilizing fluid-handling machinery. This is because collapse
	of cavitation bubbles creates locally very high stresses. The same
	mechanism can enhance breakage of agglomerates suspended in the liquid,
	when the suspension flows through the micro-nozzle. In this paper
	we investigate experimentally and numerically the flows through the
	nozzles of diameter between 80 μm and 200 μm under pressure difference
	up to 2400 bar to study deagglomeration effects. Experiments are
	performed for fumed silica Aerosil 200 V agglomerates. The cavitation
	model is used with the mixture multiphase model and k-ɛ CFD code
	by FLUENT. The CFD model is implemented with the population balance
	for agglomerates and rheological equations for aggregated suspension,
	and applied to simulate the process and interpret experimental data.
	The model predicts effects of nozzle geometry and pressure difference
	on deagglomeration. It is shown that both hydrodynamic and cavitation-induced
	stresses participate to deagglomeration, however, cavitation stresses
	are higher. Experimental results and model predictions confirm the
	hypothesis that the deagglomeration process at very high stresses
	is dominated by the shattering mechanism. It is also shown that the
	fragmentation number can be used to identify mechanism of deagglomeration.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on obtaining the numerical solution to a three-dimensional
	population balance model (PBM) of granulation using the cell-average
	technique first proposed by [22]. Conventionally, linear grids are
	used for the solution of PBMs, but the ability to incorporate non-linear
	grids would be more advantageous given that a larger size range can
	be covered using fewer number of grids, thus reducing computational
	overhead. Furthermore, the use of linear representation of grids
	in PBMs to represent industrial granulation processes that span a
	wide granule size range is computationally prohibitive and results
	show that a non-linear grid representation is computationally more
	efficient with comparable accuracy. Parallelization of the PBM via
	a multi-core strategy has also been incorporated in order to reduce
	the simulation time of the model. Incorporating the cell average
	technique along with parallelization of the overall model lends credence
	to the overall use of the model for effective granulation process
	design and analysis.},

	with the multi-class method. The effects of aggregation, feeding
	concentration, agitation speed, mean residence time, the crystal
	size distribution (CSD) at different locations and the net birth
	rate of each size bin due to aggregation are numerically studied.
	Size bin number tests show that at least 36 bins are needed for the
	size range in this work to achieve acceptable accuracy in both cases
	with and without aggregation. The predicted CSD is in good agreement
	with the reported experimental measurement. Narrower CSD and higher
	peak value are obtained with higher feed concentration. Aggregation
	broadens the CSD, decreases the peak value, and makes the CSD shift
	toward a larger size. The mean size L32 of crystals decreases significantly
	with increasing the inlet concentration, which is consistent with
	the experiments and model predictions reported in the literature.
	The effects of residence time and agitation speed on CSD and L32
	are limited, which is very different from those in unpremixed cases.
	The CSD at the inlet region differs greatly from the outlet and near
	impeller regions, both in shape and value. A bimodal distribution
	appears around the inlet under some conditions. The net birth rate
	of the ith size bin due to aggregation increases dramatically with
	the inlet concentration. The detailed information, such as the bimodal
	distribution in a certain location under certain conditions and the
	aggregation rate of each size bin, could be useful for the precise

	of the fluid mechanics occurring suggests that there are actually
	three potential damage mechanisms: collisions of a cell-covered microcarrier
	with other beads, collisions with parts of the reactor (primarily
	the impeller), and interaction with turbulent eddies the size of
	the microcarrier beads. Review of the available quantitative information
	on agitation effects in cell cultures does not establish which mechanism
	is predominant; the range of experimental variables reported emphasizes
	power input over the other reactor and impeller parameters. The bead?bead
	collision model is tentatively supported by the available data, but
	the other mechanisms may still be significant in some systems. The
	formation of bead aggregates by cellular bridging provides a parallel
	means of damaging cells. Breaking of these bridges by any of the
	three means identified earlier can cause cell destruction and/or
	the net transfer of cells to formerly bare beads. High concentrations
	of bridges are favored by lower agitation rates, presumably because
	the bridges are not as quickly destroyed after formation.},

	jets is carried out using a fully stochastic separated flow (FSSF)
	approach. As is widely used, the carrier-phase is considered in an
	Eulerian framework, while the dispersed phase is tracked in a Lagrangian
	framework following the stochastic separated flow (SSF) model. Various
	interactions between the two phases are taken into account by means
	of two-way coupling. Spray evaporation is described using a thermal
	model with an infinite conductivity in the liquid phase. The gas-phase
	turbulence terms are closed using the k-ε model. A novel mixture
	fraction based approach is used to stochastically model the fluctuating
	temperature and composition in the gas phase and these are then used
	to refine the estimates of the heat and mass transfer rates between
	the droplets and the surrounding gas-phase. In classical SSF (CSSF)
	methods, stochastic fluctuations of only the gas-phase velocity are
	modeled. Successful implementation of the FSSF approach to turbulent
	nonreacting and reacting spray jets is demonstrated. Results are
	compared against experimental measurements as well as with predictions
	using the CSSF approach for both nonreacting and reacting spray jets.
	The FSSF approach shows little difference from the CSSF predictions
	for nonreacting spray jets but differences are significant for reacting
	spray jets. In general, the FSSF approach gives good predictions
	of the flame length and structure but further improvements in modeling
	may be needed to improve the accuracy of some details of the predictions.},

	single-use and resuable bioreactors have been done at industrial
	scale. So, the aim of this work is to critically compare hydrodynamics
	in a Cultibag STR (SUB) and a reusable bioreactor (SSB). The operating
	conditions and comparison criteria have been chosen in relation to
	adherent cell cultures. The flow structure and the spatial distribution
	of mechanical stress were characterized using CFD. A CFD-based compartment
	model was used to compare mixing and, finally, the trajectories of
	several particles was simulated with a stochastic model to obtain
	circulation and residence time distributions in zones of high mechanical
	stress. Significant differences in terms of hydrodynamics are observed
	between the two bioreactors. Because of the absence of baffles, the
	flow in the single-use bioreactor is highly tangential compared to
	the SSB. As a consequence, the mixing time in the SUB is 2.5 times
	longer. In the case of adherent animal cell cultures, mechanical
	stress is usually considered as the main limiting factor related
	to hydrodynamics. So, the spatial and temporal distribution of mechanical
	stress have been compared. The results show that the cells grown
	in the SUB bioreactor will be not only more frequently exposed to
	high mechanical stress, but also over a longer period.},

  abstract  = {Solid-liquid suspensions in stirred tank reactors are common operations
	in many processes, including bioprocesses such as animal or stem
	cell cultures. These cells are often anchorage-dependent, i.e. they
	need to adhere to a surface to grow. Typically, they are cultivated
	on the surface of small spherical microbeads, the so-called microcarriers,
	suspended in stirred-tank bioreactors. As far as we know, no extensive
	experimental characterization, and thus no validated simulation approach,
	of microcarrier suspensions in stirred-tank reactor exists in the
	literature. Therefore, the first aim of this work is to develop an
	experimental technique based on light attenuation to characterize
	the spatial distribution of particle concentration for various particle
	suspension states. The second aim is to determine the validity of
	Euler-Euler CFD simulations to predict the spatial distribution of
	low density particles, such as microcarriers, in a stirred tank bioreactor.
	Experiments and simulations were performed in a small hemispherical
	bottom bioreactor stirred with a down-pumping axial impeller. The
	particles used were Cytodex-1 microcarriers (dP=162μm and ρS=1020 kg m−3)
	at a solid concentration of 10% in volume. The light attenuation
	technique enabled the characterization of the spatial distribution
	of the solid phase in the whole bioreactor, even for very dense suspensions
	by advantageously using the optical properties of the Cytodex-1 microcarriers.
	The analysis of the solid spatial distribution shows that the bioreactor
	volume can be divided in three distinct zones: a clear layer below
	the free surface where αS,layer tends to 0, a bulk zone where the
	solid phase is homogeneously distributed (αS,bulk⩽αS) and a packed
	bed of motionless particles at the bottom (αS,bed=αS,max). One very
	interesting finding is that the evolution of the bulk solid concentration
	is directly proportional to the agitation rate and its value equals
	the averaged volume fraction αS,bulk=αS at N=Njs. Concerning the
	simulation results, the modeling approach presented in this work
	enables a reasonable estimation of the just-suspended agitation rate
	Njs. Nevertheless, the solid spatial distributions are not well predicted
	for agitation rates below or above Njs. The solid concentration at
	the vessel bottom is underestimated for N<Njs but overestimated for
	N⩾Njs.},

	nanoparticles (CDNP) following inhalation exposure. CDNP originate
	from a number of sources and in this review we consider diesel soot,
	welding fume, carbon black and coal fly ash. A substantial literature
	demonstrates that these pose a hazard to the lungs through their
	potential to cause oxidative stress, inflammation and cancer; they
	also have the potential to redistribute to other organs following
	pulmonary deposition. These different CDNP show considerable heterogeneity
	in composition and solubility, meaning that oxidative stress may
	originate from different components depending on the particle under
	consideration. Key CDNP-associated properties of large surface area
	and the presence of metals and organics all have the potential to
	produce oxidative stress. CDNP may also exert genotoxic effects,
	depending on their composition. CDNP and their components also have
	the potential to translocate to the brain and also the blood, and
	thereby reach other targets such as the cardiovascular system, spleen
	and liver. CDNP therefore can be seen as a group of particulate toxins
	unified by a common mechanism of injury and properties of translocation
	which have the potential to mediate a range of adverse effects in
	the lungs and other organs and warrant further research.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In biotechnology and biomedicine reliable models of cell
	proliferation kinetics need to capture the relevant phenomena taking
	place during the mitotic cycle. To this aim, a novel mathematical
	model helpful to investigate the intrinsic kinetics of in vitro culture
	of adherent cells up to confluence is proposed in this work. Specifically,
	the attention is focused on the simulation of proliferation (increase
	of cell number) and maturation (increase of cell size and DNA content)
	till contact inhibition eventually takes place inside a Petri dish.
	Accordingly, the proposed model is based on a population balance
	(PB) approach that allows one to quantitatively describe cell cycle
	progression through the different phases the cells of the entire
	population experienced during their own life. In particular, the
	proposed model has been developed as a 2D, multi-staged, and unstructured
	PB, by considering a different sub-population of cells for any single
	phase of the cell cycle. These sub-populations are discriminated
	through cellular volume and DNA content, that both increase during
	the mitotic cycle. The adopted mathematical expressions of the transition
	rates between two subsequent phases and the temporal increase of
	cell volume and DNA content are thoroughly analyzed and discussed
	with respect to those ones available in the literature. Specifically,
	the corresponding uncertainties and pitfalls are pointed out, by
	also taking into account the difficulties and the limitations involved
	in the quantitative measurements currently practicable for these
	biological systems. A novel mathematical expression for contact inhibition
	in line with the PB model developed is also formulated, along with
	a proper comparison between modeled and measurable DNA distributions.
	The strategy for a reliable, independent tuning of the adjustable
	parameters involved in the proposed model along with its numerical
	solution is outlined in Part II of this work, where it is also shown
	how it can be profitably used to gain a deeper insight into the phenomena
	involved during cell cultivation under microgravity conditions. Biotechnol.

	I of this work, a series of numerical simulations related to the

	First the complex task of assigning a specific value to all the parameters
	of the proposed population balance (PB) model is addressed, by also
	highlighting the difficulties arising when performing proper comparisons
	with experimental data. Then, a parametric sensitivity analysis is
	performed, thus identifying the more relevant parameters from a kinetics
	perspective. The proposed PB model can be adapted to describe cell
	growth under various conditions, by properly changing the value of
	the adjustable parameters. For this reason, model parameters able
	to mimic cell culture behavior under microgravity conditions are
	identified by means of a suitable parametric sensitivity analysis.
	Specifically, it is found that, as the volume growth parameter is
	reduced, proliferation slows down while cells arrest in G0/G1 or
	G2/M depending on the initial distribution of cell population. On
	the basis of this result, model capabilities have been tested by
	means of a proper comparison with literature experimental data related
	to the behavior of synchronized and not-synchronized cells under

	steady and pulsatile shear stresses under well-controlled conditions.
	Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers were subjected to
	steady shear stresses of up to 24 dynes/cm2, and the production of
	prostacyclin was determined. The onset of flow led to a burst in
	prostacyclin production which decayed to a long term steady state
	rate (SSR). The SSR of cells exposed to flow was greater than the
	basal release level, and increased linearly with increasing shear
	stress. This study demonstrates that shear stress in certain ranges
	may not be detrimental to mammalian cell metabolism. In fact, throughout
	the range of shear stresses studied, metabolite production is maximized
	by maximizing shear stress.},

	over a cultivation time of 28 days, which could reveal cell growth

	cell proliferation. After enzymatic harvest from microcarriers, the

	without external sources of biomass after they have been inoculated.
	However, other kinds of bioreactors, such as the second and subsequent
	reactors in a cascade of CSTRs, operate with continuous introduction
	of biomass from one or more external sources. The biomass in a bioreactor
	with an external source is not homogeneous with respect to past history
	of environmental conditions, and growth of this biomass is not balanced
	(steady-state) growth even when the bioreactor operates in steady
	state. So-called unstructured models of growth, which assume biomass
	to lack any internal structure or to have an invariant internal state,
	can give only a first approximation to the growth rate behavior of
	the biomass in a bioreactor with an external source of biomass. Structured
	models, which endow biomass with a changeable internal structure,
	are required to obtain more accurate predictions of growth rate behavior
	in such reactors. Introduction of structure is not sufficient for
	improved accuracy, however, and the fact that biomasses from different
	sources are remain segregated from one another must also be accounted
	for by any structured growth model used. This article presents, among
	others, the systems of different equations that result from application
	of the notions to the reactors of a cascade of CSTRs.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, several sophisticated packages based on the method
	of lines (MOL) have been developed for the automatic numerical integration
	of time-dependent problems in partial differential equations (PDEs),
	notably for problems in one space dimension. These packages greatly
	benefit from the very successful developments of automatic stiff
	ordinary differential equation solvers. However, from the PDE point
	of view, they integrate only in a semiautomatic way in the sense
	that they automatically adjust the time step sizes, but use just
	a fixed space grid, chosen a priori, for the entire calculation.
	For solutions possessing sharp spatial transitions that move, e.g.,
	travelling wave fronts or emerging boundary and interior layers,
	a grid held fixed for the entire calculation is computationally inefficient,
	since for a good solution this grid often must contain a very large
	number of nodes. In such cases methods which attempt automatically
	to adjust the sizes of both the space and the time steps are likely
	to be more successful in efficiently resolving critical regions of
	high spatial and temporal activity. Methods and codes that operate
	this way belong to the realm of adaptive or moving-grid methods.
	Following the MOL approach, this paper is devoted to an evaluation
	and comparison, mainly based on extensive numerical tests, of three
	moving-grid methods for 1D problems, viz., the finite-element method
	of Miller and co-workers, the method published by Petzold, and a
	method based on ideas adopted from Dorfi and Drury. Our examination
	of these three methods is aimed at assessing which is the most suitable
	from the point of view of retaining the acknowledged features of
	reliability, robustness, and efficiency of the conventional MOL approach.
	Therefore, considerable attention is paid to the temporal performance
	of the methods.},

  abstract  = {Nano-particles produced at high temperatures often undergo rapid coalescence
	with complex associated rate laws. In this paper we develop and study
	the numerical properties of a stochastic algorithm for the modelling
	of nano-particle dynamics in the free molecular regime. Following
	the work in A. Eibeck and W. Wagner (2000, SIAM J. Sci. Comput.22(3),
	802-821), we model the system as a Markov process and introduce a
	new majorant kernel that enables us to extend the use of fictitious
	jumps to a wider class of problems. We also include a source term.
	We study the convergence properties of the algorithm; the systematic
	error decreases as 1N. We then examine the efficiency of the algorithm
	by comparing it to a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm,
	that described by D. T. Gillespie (1975, J. Atmos. Sci.32(10), 1977-1989).
	We also compare the efficiency of our new majorant with the linear
	majorant used in A. Eibeck and W. Wagner (2001, Ann. Appl. Prob.11(4),
	1137-1165). The improved stochastic algorithm compares very favourably
	with the DSMC algorithm. The CPU time required for simulation is
	orders of magnitude lower, and for low particle numbers, the CPU
	time increases linearly with particle number, rather than as the
	square of the particle number (as with the DSMC algorithm). Our majorant
	kernel enables us to simulate solutions to a wider variety of problems
	than the linear majorant and also gives a significant gain in efficiency.
	The results of this report promise excellent efficiency of simulation
	of problems such as soot formation and synthesis of fumed silica,
	and also for extension to a more general class of problems in which
	the population balance equation occurs.},

  abstract = {A coupled direct numerical simulation (DNS)--population balance equation
	(PBE)-DLVO approach is presented to calculate the product properties
	of particles originating from precipitation in a T-mixer. A special
	focus is given to the coupling of different subprocesses such as
	mixing, nucleation, growth, stabilization and aggregation for a rapid
	precipitation process. Based on the predictive computation of the
	resulting particle size distributions (PSD) full 3D-field information
	of all transient parameters are accessible, e.g., supersaturations,
	nucleation rates, particle sizes and stabilities. By interpolating
	the kinetic data, relevant subprocesses can be visualized and studied
	separately in the mixer. The resulting PSDs are predicted for different
	conditions where aggregation can be neglected. For unstable conditions
	aggregation and transient stabilization effects are determined by
	the DLVO theory. The size of the particles, their surface potential
	and the ionic strength of the solution vary extensively during the
	solid formation process. The dynamic evolution of the particle stability
	leads to a better description of the PSD based on the DNS-PBE-DLVO
	approach for unstable conditions and allows to develop strategies
	how to better stabilize particles. This approach is verified for
	barium sulphate precipitation but can be transferred to any other
	ionic system for which the relevant material specific data are known.},

	The new class of multistaged corpuscular models allows further structuring

	facilitates the incorporation of cell cycle phenomena to population
	models. These multistaged models consist of systems of population
	balance equations coupled by appropriate boundary conditions. The
	specific form of the equations depend on the assumed forms for the
	transition rate functions, the growth rate functions, and the partitioning

	demonstrate the proposed framework. To obtain a solution to the system
	of the partial integro differential equations that results from such
	formulation, we adopted a Monte Carlo simulation technique which
	is very stable, versatile, and insensitive to the complexity of the

	The switching between these states has long been understood as a
	transition between attractor states of a molecular network. Herein,
	stochastic fluctuations are either suppressed or can trigger the
	transition, but they do not actually determine the attractor states.
	Methodology/Principal Findings We present a novel mathematical concept
	in which stem cell and progenitor population dynamics are described
	as a probabilistic process that arises from cell proliferation and
	small fluctuations in the state of differentiation. These state fluctuations
	reflect random transitions between different activation patterns
	of the underlying regulatory network. Importantly, the associated
	noise amplitudes are state-dependent and set by the environment.
	Their variability determines the attractor states, and thus actually
	governs population dynamics. This model quantitatively reproduces
	the observed dynamics of differentiation and dedifferentiation in
	promyelocytic precursor cells. Conclusions/Significance Consequently,
	state-specific noise modulation by external signals can be instrumental
	in controlling stem cell and progenitor population dynamics. We propose
	follow-up experiments for quantifying the imprinting influence of
	the environment on cellular noise regulation.},

	Navier-Stokes computations for three geometrically similar scales

	defines cavitation inception as the flow condition at which the number

	Scaling effects (i.e., deviation from the classical σi∝Re0.4) increase

	threshold pressures and less number of peaks). Larger scales tend
	to detect more cavitation inception events per unit time than obtained
	by classical scaling because a relatively larger number of nuclei
	are excited by the tip vortex at the larger scale due to simultaneous
	increase of the nuclei capture area and of the size of the vortex
	core. The average nuclei size in the nuclei distribution was also
	found to have an important impact on cavitation inception number.

	source of cells for clinical applications, especially in the field
	of regenerative medicine. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that
	the interest in hASCs has greatly increased over the last decade.
	However, in order to use hASCs in clinically relevant numbers, in
	vitro expansion is required. Single-use stirred bioreactors in combination
	with microcarriers (MCs) have shown themselves to be suitable systems
	for this task. However, hASCs tend to be less robust, and thus, more
	shear sensitive than conventional production cell lines for therapeutic
	antibodies and vaccines (e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO, Baby
	Hamster Kidney cells BHK), for which these bioreactors were originally
	designed. Hence, the goal of this study was to investigate the influence
	of different shear stress levels on the growth of humane telomerase
	reversed transcriptase immortalized hASCs (hTERT-ASC) and aggregate
	formation in stirred single-use systems at the mL scale: the 125
	mL (=SP100) and the 500 mL (=SP300) disposable Corning&reg; spinner
	flask. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based on an
	Euler&ndash;Euler and Euler&ndash;Lagrange approach were performed
	to predict the hydrodynamic stresses (0.06&ndash;0.87 Pa), the residence
	times (0.4&ndash;7.3 s), and the circulation times (1.6&ndash;16.6
	s) of the MCs in different shear zones for different impeller speeds
	and the suspension criteria (Ns1u, Ns1). The numerical findings were
	linked to experimental data from cultivations studies to develop,
	for the first time, an unstructured, segregated mathematical growth
	model for hTERT-ASCs. While the 125 mL spinner flask with 100 mL
	working volume (SP100) provided up to 1.68 &times; 105 hTERT-ASC/cm2
	(=0.63 &times; 106 living hTERT-ASCs/mL, EF 56) within eight days,
	the peak living cell density of the 500 mL spinner flask with 300
	mL working volume (SP300) was 2.46 &times; 105 hTERT-ASC/cm2 (=0.88
	&times; 106 hTERT-ASCs/mL, EF 81) and was achieved on day eight.
	Optimal cultivation conditions were found for Ns1u &lt; N &lt; Ns1,
	which corresponded to specific power inputs of 0.3&ndash;1.1 W/m3.
	The established growth model delivered reliable predictions for cell
	growth on the MCs with an accuracy of 76&ndash;96% for both investigated
	spinner flask types.},

	Besides the classical primary processes, nucleation and molecular

	case of self-assembled aggregation leads to the formation of highly

	In the experiments of these studies the particle formation of barium
	sulfate has been investigated. SEM analysis shows a large variety
	of growth forms including plate-like, star-like, and spherical particles,
	whereas TEM exposures reveal the porous internal structure at all
	investigated supersaturation levels. The pore size and the volume
	fraction can be influenced by changing the supersaturation ratio.
	By means of a fast sampling technique in combination with cryo-TEM
	analysis it has been shown that the particles at the early stages
	of growth shortly after the beginning of nucleation consist of many
	small nanocrystallites which have aggregated in a highly ordered
	manner. The diffraction pattern indicates many small-angle grain
	boundaries, whereas the particles at the end of the precipitation
	process are monocrystalline. This leads to the conclusion that barium
	sulfate grows according to a self-assembled aggregation mechanism
	followed by a fast recrystallization process.},

	pairs. The particle evolution was computed as a stochastic game,
	computing the time step after each collision. The simulations were
	validated by comparing with exact mathematical solutions for aggregation
	of solid particles and with numerical solutions based on sectional
	methods for coagulation of droplets. The direct simulation Monte
	Carlo (DSMC) method is advantageous, because the simulation of complex,
	multidimensional systems results in very elaborate models when using
	sectional models and is implemented very easily. Two examples of
	industrial importance are chemical reaction in coagulating droplets
	and coating of particles with small solid particles.},

  abstract = {A new framework for the discretization of continuous population balance
	equations (PBEs) is presented in this work. It proposes that the
	discrete equations for aggregation or breakage processes be internally
	consistent with regard to the desired moments of the distribution.
	Based on this framework, a numerical technique has been developed.
	It considers particle populations in discrete and contiguous size
	ranges to be concentrated at representative volumes. Particulate
	events leading to the formation of particle sizes other than the
	representative sizes are incorporated in the set of discrete equations
	such that properties corresponding to two moments of interest are
	exactly preserved. The technique presented here is applicable to
	binary or multiple breakage, aggregation, simultaneous breakage and
	aggregation, and can be adapted to predict the desired properties
	of an evolving size distribution more precisely. Existing approaches
	employ successively fine grids to improve the accuracy of the numerical
	results. However, a simple analysis of the aggregation process shows
	that significant errors are introduced due to steeply varying number
	densities across a size range. Therefore, a new strategy involving
	selective refinement of a relatively coarse grid while keeping the
	number of sections to a minimum, is demonstrated for one particular
	case. Furthermore, it has been found that the technique is quite
	general and yields excellent predictions in all cases. This technique
	is particularly useful for solving a large class of problems involving
	discrete-continuous PBEs such as polymerization-depolymerization,
	aerosol dynamics, etc.},

	and the immortalized cell line hMSC-TERT. A serum-containing medium

	We observed cell type-dependent differences in growth rate and attachment
	behavior on each microcarrier. Missing serum components in the CDM
	led to slower cell attachment and growth, whereas microcarriers suitable
	for the SCM were also suitable for CDM. Glass-coated microcarriers
	supported hMSC-TERT growth and bead-to-bead transfer in SCM, whereas
	plasma-treated plastic surfaces promoted cell growth in CDM. We demonstrated
	that stem cell cultures can be scaled up by bead-to-bead transfer,

	MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes
	of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary

	improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common
	and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after

	the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting
	immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK
	cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid)

	For low values of DBP vapour mole fraction, the size distributions
	were unimodal and the aerosol concentration followed jet dilution
	profiles, indicating that the particle formation was confined to
	the initial region of the jet. The final aerosol concentrations were
	correlated by simple scaling laws. For higher vapour mole fractions,
	nucleation continued to occur downstream from the shear layer, resulting

  abstract = {Laminar diffusion flames present an elementary configuration for investigating
	soot formation and validating kinetic models before these are transferred
	to turbulent combustors. In the present article, we present a joint
	experimental and modelling investigation of soot formation in a laminar
	co-flow burner. The diffusion flames are analysed with the aid of
	laser diagnostic techniques, including elastic light scattering (ELS),
	planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH (OH-PLIF) and line-of-sight
	attenuation (LOSA), to measure the spatial distribution of soot,
	gas phase species and the line-of-sight integrated soot volume fraction
	(ISVF), respectively. The experimental dataset is supplemented by
	location-specific TEM images of thermophoretically sampled soot particles.
	The simulation of the sooting flames is carried out with a recently
	developed discretisation method for the population balance equation
	(Liu and Rigopoulos, 2019, Combust. Flame 205, 506-521) that accomplishes
	an accurate prediction of the particle size distribution, coupled
	with an in-house CFD code. By minimising numerical errors, we ensure
	that the discrepancies on the modelling side are mainly due to kinetics
	and are able to carry out an investigation of alternative models.
	We include a complete set of soot kinetics for PAH-based nucleation
	and condensation, HACA-based surface growth and oxidation as well
	as size-dependent aggregation, and consider three different gas phase
	reaction mechanisms (ABF, BBP and KM2). Based on predictions of the
	gas phase composition and particle size distribution of soot, modelled
	counterparts of the laser diagnostic signals are computed and compared
	with the experimental measurements. The approach of directly predicting
	signals circumvents the difficulties of explicitly representing the
	OH concentration in terms of the measured OH-PLIF data and avoids
	using ‘hybrid’ modelled and measured values to approximate the OH
	concentration. Moreover, the LOSA signal is directly converted to
	the line-of-sight ISVF instead of a measure of local soot volume
	fraction to avoid tomographic inversion errors. Lastly, the predicted
	ELS signal is computed in terms of the particle size distribution
	resolved by the population balance model, thus circumventing the
	approximation of an integral soot property using a presumed size
	distribution. While we cannot obtain quantitative agreement between
	experiments and simulations, the accuracy of the numerical approach
	and the direct prediction of experimental signals allow us to conduct
	sensitivity analyses of key empirical parameters and investigate
	the importance of the PAH chemistry and its influence on the competition
	between nucleation, condensation and surface growth.},

	a coagulation process and it represents conservation of mass. The
	method is based on a geometric evaluation of the double integrals
	arising from the finite volume discretisation of the coagulation
	terms and an exact balance of coagulation source and sink terms to
	ensure moment conservation. Extensive testing is performed by comparison
	with analytical solutions and direct numerical solutions of the discrete
	PBE for both theoretical and physically important coagulation kernels.
	Finally, the method is applied to the simulation of a laminar co-flow
	diffusion sooting flame, in order to assess its potential for coupling
	with CFD, chemical kinetics, transport and radiation models. The
	results show that accurate solutions can be obtained with a small
	number of sections, and that the PBE solution requires less than
	one fourth of the time of the complete simulation, only half of which
	is spent on the discretisation (the remaining being for the evaluation
	of the temperature dependence of the coagulation kernel).},

	on cell volume, and transition probability from S to G2M is determined
	by DNA content. The model can be used to simulate the dynamics of
	DNA content and cell volume distributions, phase fractions, and substrate
	and byproduct concentrations, as well as cell densities. Measurements
	from myeloma cell cultivations, especially the FACS data with respect

	techniques namely, the Galerkin on finite elements method (GFEM),
	the generalized method of moments (GMOM) and the stochastic Monte
	Carlo (MC) method. Numerical simulations were carried out over a
	wide range of variation of particle aggregation and growth rate models.
	The performance of the selected techniques was assessed in terms

	results revealed that, in general, the GFEM provides more accurate
	predictions of the particle size distribution (PSD) than the other
	two methods, however, at the expense of more computational effort
	and time. On the other hand, the GMOM yields very accurate predictions
	of selected moments of the distribution and has minimal computational
	requirements. However, its main disadvantage is related to its inherent
	difficulty in reconstructing the original distribution using a finite
	set of calculated moments. Finally, stochastic MC simulations can
	provide very accurate predictions of both PSD and its corresponding

	of a multiphase system composed of water, 1-dodecene, and a non-ionic
	surfactant, is investigated. Within the employed ranges of temperature
	and phase composition, this system exists in a three-phase configuration,
	consisting of an aqueous, an organic, and a surfactant-rich middle
	phase. Following the reaction step, a complete separation of the
	aqueous phase, in which the expensive rhodium catalyst is dissolved,

	the drop size distribution (DSD) of the disperse phases using an
	endoscopic measurement technique. Based on these experimental data,
	a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model employing the Euler-Euler
	multi-fluid framework coupled with the Extended Quadrature Method
	of Moments (EQMOM) for the solution of the population balance equations
	(PBEs) for each disperse phase is implemented using OpenFOAM. Within
	the framework of this CFD-PBE model, a buoyancy-induced coalescence
	model, which has been previously shown to accurately predict the
	degree of separation, has been employed. This multi-fluid CFD-PBE
	model has been used for simulating the separation of the three-phase
	system in a double-wall glass tank. The time-evolution of observed
	phase heights is used to fit the model parameters of the coalescence
	kernel. Subsequently, this numerical model has been used for simulating
	the gravity-driven separation in a horizontal settler equipped with
	a coalescer. The predictions of this numerical model are in good
	agreement with the experimentally observed values.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT The success of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a
	source of future cell therapies hinges, in part, on the availability
	of a robust and scalable culture system that can readily produce
	a clinically relevant number of cells and their derivatives. Stirred
	suspension culture has been identified as one such promising platform
	due to its ease of use, scalability, and widespread use in the pharmaceutical
	industry (e.g., CHO cell-based production of therapeutic proteins)
	among others. However, culture of undifferentiated hPSCs in stirred
	suspension is a relatively new development within the past several
	years, and little is known beyond empirically optimized culture parameters.
	In particular, detailed characterizations of different agitation
	rates and their influence on the propagation of hPSCs are often not
	reported in the literature. In the current study, we systematically
	investigated various agitation rates to characterize their impact
	on cell yield, viability, and the maintenance of pluripotency. Additionally,
	we closely examined the distribution of cell aggregates and how the
	observed culture outcomes are attributed to their size distribution.
	Overall, our results showed that moderate agitation maximized the
	propagation of hPSCs to approximately 38-fold over 7 days by keeping
	the cell aggregates below the critical size, beyond which the cells
	are impacted by the diffusion limit, while limiting cell death caused
	by excessive fluidic forces. Furthermore, we observed that fluidic
	agitation could regulate not only cell aggregation, but also expression
	of some key signaling proteins in hPSCs. This indicates a new possibility
	to guide stem cell fate determination by fluidic agitation in stirred
	suspension cultures. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2017;114: 2109?2120. ? 2017

  pages = {9--33},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {This article mainly addresses the issues associated with the engineering
	of large-scale free suspension culture in agitated bioreactors >10,000 L
	because they have become the system of choice industrially. It is
	particularly concerned with problems that become increasingly important
	as the scale increases. However, very few papers have been written
	that are actually based on such large-scale studies and the few that
	do rarely address any of the issues quantitatively. Hence, it is
	necessary very often to extrapolate from small-scale work and this
	review tries to pull the two types of study together. It is shown
	that ‘shear sensitivity’ due to agitation and bursting bubbles is
	no longer considered a major problem. Homogeneity becomes increasingly
	important with respect to pH and nutrients at the largest scale and
	sub-surface feeding is recommended despite ‘cleaning in place’ concerns.
	There are still major questions with cell retention/recycle systems
	at these scales, either because of fouling, of capacity or of potential
	and different ‘shear sensitivity’ questions. Fed-batch operation
	gives rise to cell densities that have led to the use of oxygen and
	enriched air to meet oxygen demands. This strategy, in turn, gives
	rise to a CO2 evolution rate that impacts on pH control, pCO2 and
	osmolality. These interactions are difficult to resolve but if higher
	sparge and agitation intensities could be used to achieve the necessary
	oxygen transfer, the problem would largely disappear. Thus, the perception
	of ‘shear sensitivity’ is still impacting on the development of animal
	cell culture at the commercial scale. Microcarrier culture is also
	briefly addressed. Finally, some recommendations for bioreactor configuration
	and operating strategy are given.},

  abstract  = {The use of hMSCs for allogeneic therapies requiring lot sizes of billions
	of cells will necessitate large-scale culture techniques such as
	the expansion of cells on microcarriers in bioreactors. Whilst much
	research investigating hMSC culture on microcarriers has focused
	on growth, much less involves their harvesting for passaging or as
	a step towards cryopreservation and storage. A successful new harvesting
	method has recently been outlined for cells grown on SoloHill microcarriers
	in a 5L bioreactor [1]. Here, this new method is set out in detail,
	harvesting being defined as a two-step process involving cell ‘detachment’
	from the microcarriers’ surface followed by the ‘separation’ of the
	two entities. The new detachment method is based on theoretical concepts
	originally developed for secondary nucleation due to agitation. Based
	on this theory, it is suggested that a short period (here 7min) of
	intense agitation in the presence of a suitable enzyme should detach
	the cells from the relatively large microcarriers. In addition, once
	detached, the cells should not be damaged because they are smaller
	than the Kolmogorov microscale. Detachment was then successfully
	achieved for hMSCs from two different donors using microcarrier/cell
	suspensions up to 100mL in a spinner flask. In both cases, harvesting
	was completed by separating cells from microcarriers using a Steriflip®
	vacuum filter. The overall harvesting efficiency was >95% and after
	harvesting, the cells maintained all the attributes expected of hMSC
	cells. The underlying theoretical concepts suggest that the method
	is scalable and this aspect is discussed too.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside under hypoxic
	conditions in vivo, between 4% and 7% oxygen. Differentiation of
	MSCs under hypoxic conditions results in inhibited osteogenesis,
	while chondrogenesis is unaffected. The reasons for these results
	may be associated with the inherent metabolism of the cells. The
	present investigation measured the oxygen consumption, glucose consumption
	and lactate production of MSCs during proliferation and subsequent
	differentiation towards the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages.
	MSCs expanded under normoxia had an oxygen consumption rate of ?98?fmol/cell/h,
	75% of which was azide-sensitive, suggesting that these cells derive
	a significant proportion of ATP from oxidative phosphorylation in
	addition to glycolysis. By contrast, MSCs differentiated towards
	the chondrogenic lineage using pellet culture had significantly reduced
	oxygen consumption after 24?h in culture, falling to ?12?fmol/cell/h
	after 21 days, indicating a shift towards a predominantly glycolytic
	metabolism. By comparison, MSCs retained an oxygen consumption rate
	of ?98?fmol/cell/h over 21 days of osteogenic culture conditions,
	indicating that these cells had a more oxidative energy metabolism
	than the chondrogenic cultures. In conclusion, osteogenic and chondrogenic
	MSC cultures appear to adopt the balance of oxidative phosphorylation
	and glycolysis reported for the respective mature cell phenotypes.
	The addition of TGF-? to chondrogenic pellet cultures significantly
	enhanced glycosaminoglycan accumulation, but caused no significant
	effect on cellular oxygen consumption. Thus, the differences between
	the energy metabolism of chondrogenic and osteogenic cultures may
	be associated with the culture conditions and not necessarily their
	respective differentiation. J. Cell. Physiol. 226: 2562?2570, 2011.

	relates the dispersity to the product properties, whereas the process
	function shows how to produce the required dispersity. These principles
	are applied to the production of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are
	controlled by surface forces. Due to their high mobility nanoparticles
	are unstable and may coagulate rapidly if the particles are not stabilized.
	Stabilization is achieved by tailoring the particulate surfaces,
	e.g. through repulsive double layer forces. Macroscopic properties
	are thus controlled by microscopic control of the interfaces, i.e.
	we bridge the gap between the molecular level and material properties.
	These principles are generally valid and are thus applied to precipitation
	and to nanomilling in stirred ball mills. The mean particle size
	in precipitation can be controlled by either the mixing intensity
	or the surface charge density of the particles. In stirred media
	mills oxide particles as small as 10 nm can be achieved by stabilizing
	the particles appropriately.},

	found that the use of 5 moments to describe a distribution of growth-rate
	over the population gives satisfactory accuracy against a simulation
	with a hundred classes. Thus, all methods of moments allow a significant
	decrease of memory usage in simulations. In terms of stability, QMOM

	a variety of mechanisms that include association with cyclins and

  abstract  = {Cell growth in a chemostat is a well-documented research topic. How
	cells uptake the available substrate to gain weight and engage cell
	division is not generally taken into account in the modelling bioreactors.
	In fact, the growth rate is related to a population doubling time
	whereas the microorganisms’ growth in mass is due to the mass transfer
	of substrates from the liquid phase to the biotic phase. Clearly,
	growth in mass precedes growth in number. Similarly, the transport
	of substrates down to the cell scale precedes the mass transfer.
	This article's main feature is a two-dimensional population balance
	model that allows to uncouple growth in mass and growth in number
	when the equilibrium between a cell population and its environment
	is disrupted. The cell length and the rate of anabolism are chosen
	as internal variables. It is proved that the hypothesis “growth in
	number=growth in mass” is valid at steady-state or in exponential
	growth only. The glucose uptake is assumed driven by two transport
	systems with a different affinity constant for the substrate. This
	combination of two regulated uptake systems operating in parallel
	explains a 3-fold increase in the uptake following a glucose pulse,
	but can also predict substrate uptake rates higher than the maximal
	batch value as observed in some experiments. These features are obtained
	by considering carbon fluxes in the formulation of regulation principles
	for uptake dynamics. The population balance's implementation in a
	multi-compartment reactor is a natural prospective work and allows
	extensions to industrial processes.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) therapies have the potential
	to revolutionise the healthcare industry and replicate the success
	of the therapeutic protein industry; however, for this to be achieved
	there is a need to apply key bioprocessing engineering principles
	and adopt a quantitative approach for large-scale reproducible hMSC
	bioprocess development. Here we provide a quantitative analysis of
	the changes in concentration of glucose, lactate and ammonium with
	time during hMSC monolayer culture over 4 passages, under 100% and
	20% dissolved oxgen (dO2), where either a 100%, 50% or 0% growth
	medium exchange was performed after 72h in culture. Yield coefficients,
	specific growth rates (h-1) and doubling times (h) were calculated
	for all cases. The 100% dO2 flasks outperformed the 20% dO2 flasks
	with respect to cumulative cell number, with the latter consuming
	more glucose and producing more lactate and ammonium. Furthermore,
	the 100% and 50% medium exchange conditions resulted in similar cumulative
	cell numbers, whilst the 0% conditions were significantly lower.
	Cell immunophenotype and multipotency were not affected by the experimental
	culture conditions. This study demonstrates the importance of determining
	optimal culture conditions for hMSC expansion and highlights a potential
	cost savings from only making a 50% medium exchange, which may prove
	significant for large-scale bioprocessing.},

  abstract  = {Musculoskeletal disorders represent a major cause of disability and
	morbidity globally and result in enormous costs for health and social
	care systems. Development of cell-based therapies is rapidly proliferating
	in a number of disease areas, including musculoskeletal disorders.
	Novel biological therapies that can effectively treat joint and spine
	degeneration are high priorities in regenerative medicine. Mesenchymal
	stem cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow (BM-MSCs), adipose tissue
	(AD-MSCs) and umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) show considerable promise
	for use in cartilage and intervertebral disc (IVD) repair. This review
	article focuses on stem cell-based therapeutics for cartilage and
	IVD repair in the context of the rising global burden of musculoskeletal
	disorders. We discuss the biology MSCs and chondroprogenitor cells
	and specifically focus on umbilical cord/Wharton’s jelly derived
	MSCs and examine their potential for regenerative applications. We
	also summarize key components of the molecular machinery and signaling
	pathways responsible for the control of chondrogenesis and explore
	biomimetic scaffolds and biomaterials for articular cartilage and
	IVD regeneration. This review explores the exciting opportunities
	afforded by MSCs and discusses the challenges associated with cartilage
	and IVD repair and regeneration. There are still many technical challenges
	associated with isolating, expanding, differentiating, and pre-conditioning
	MSCs for subsequent implantation into degenerate joints and the spine.
	However, the prospect of combining biomaterials and cell-based therapies
	that incorporate chondrocytes, chondroprogenitors and MSCs leads
	to the optimistic view that interdisciplinary approaches will lead
	to significant breakthroughs in regenerating musculoskeletal tissues,
	such as the joint and the spine in the near future.},

  abstract = {Aerosol dynamics plays an important role in the modelling of soot
	formation in combustion processes, as it is responsible for predicting
	the distribution of size and shape of soot particles. The distribution
	is required for the correct prediction of the rates of surface processes,
	such as growth and oxidation, and furthermore it is important on
	its own because new regulations on particulate emissions require
	control of the number of smaller particles. Soot formation is strongly
	dependent on the local chemical composition and thermodynamic conditions
	and is therefore coupled with fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics and
	transport phenomena. Comprehensive modelling of soot formation in
	combustion processes requires coupling of the population balance
	equation, which is the fundamental equation governing aerosol dynamics,
	with the equations of fluid dynamics. The presence of turbulence
	poses an additional challenge, due to the non-linear interactions
	between fluctuating velocity, temperature, concentrations and soot
	properties. The purpose of this work is to review the progress made
	in aerosol dynamics models, their integration with fluid dynamics
	and the models for addressing the turbulence-soot interaction.},

	(volume) and shape as well as space and time. Potentially, other

  abstract  = {This paper presents large eddy simulation (LES) of polydispersed turbulent
	recirculating flows using a two-way coupled probability density function
	of the population balance equation (PDF-PBE). A stochastic Monte
	Carlo method is adopted to solve the PDF-PBE on an ensemble of notional
	Lagrangian particles and the method of Stokes binning, that was recently
	developed by Salehi et al. (2017) is employed to explicitly treat
	effects of inertia. The PDF-PBE is applied to the experiment of Boŕee
	et al. (2001) which studied dispersion of polysized inertial particles
	in a bluff body configuration. The particle mass loading is 22% where
	the dispersed elements affect the carrier phase velocity. The simulations
	are performed using both the standard Smagorinsky and the Wall-Adapting
	Local Eddy-viscosity (WALE) subgird turbulent models. It is found
	that the subgrid model has a significant impact on the results, particularly
	on the carrier velocity. The WALE model shows a better agreement
	with the measurements. Different boundary conditions are tested for
	injection of notional particles. It is demonstrated both dispersed
	and carrier phase velocities are initially sensitive to the particle
	boundary condition whereas the difference between tested conditions
	becomes marginal further downstream. The best results are obtained
	for the particle boundary condition that accounts for effects of
	inertia at the inlet. Finally, the sensitivity of the PDF-PBE simulations
	to the number of Stokes bins is studied. It is found that eight Stokes
	bins are enough to accurately model the polysized particles dispersion
	in a bluff body configuration. The results indicate that particle
	dispersion is notably sensitive to the number of Stokes bins but
	the particle velocity predictions are much less sensitive with small
	variation in velocity results over the range of Stokes bins that
	were tested.},

	controlling or tailoring particle size distributions (PSDs) in many

	determine the stability using barium sulfate as the model substance.
	The experimental data is obtained by measuring the temporal evolution
	of the PSD. A detailed aggregation model is presented based on the
	population balance equation including the influence of particle-particle
	interactions via the so-called stability ratio W. Values for this
	ratio are determined by a parameter estimation strategy from the
	experimental data and then successfully correlated via the surface
	charge density to the adsorption of potential-determining ions (
	H + - and Ba 2 + -ions in the investigated system). The model is
	validated and its ability to capture the influence of ionic strength
	and particle size is tested successfully. Many insights are gained
	and favorable feed concentrations for the production of nanoparticles

  abstract = {Nanoparticle precipitation is an interesting process to generate particles
	with tailored properties. In this study we investigate the impact
	of various process steps such as solid formation, mixing and agglomeration
	on the resulting particle size distribution (PSD) as representative
	property using barium sulfate as exemplary material. Besides the
	experimental investigation, process simulations were carried out
	by solving the full 1D population balance equation coupled to a model
	describing the micromixing kinetics based on a finite-element Galerkin
	h-p-method. This combination of population balance and micromixing
	model was applied successfully to predict the influence of mixing
	on mean sizes (good quantitative agreement between experimental data
	and simulation results are obtained) and gain insights into nanoparticle
	precipitation: The interfacial energy was identified to be a critical
	parameter in predicting the particle size, poor mixing results in
	larger particles and the impact of agglomeration was found to increase
	with supersaturation due to larger particle numbers. Shear-induced
	agglomeration was found to be controllable through the residence
	time in turbulent regions and the intensity of turbulence, necessary
	for intense mixing but undesired due to agglomeration. By this approach,
	however, the distribution width is underestimated which is attributed
	to the large spectrum of mixing histories of fluid elements on their
	way through the mixer. Therefore, an improved computational fluid
	dynamics-based approach using direct numerical simulation with a
	Lagrangian particle tracking strategy is applied in combination with
	the coupled population balance-micromixing approach. We found that
	the full DNS-approach, coupled to the population balance and micromixing
	model is capable of predicting not only the mean sizes but the full
	PSD in nanoparticle precipitation.},

	rate is important, as these quantities are used for many mixing models.
	For this reason we conduct a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of
	a confined impinging jet reactor (CIJR) at Re = 500 and Sc = 1. The
	data is compared with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements
	and the basic flow features match between simulation and experiment.
	The DNS data is analysed and it is shown that the flow is dominated
	by a stable vortex in the main mixing duct. High intensities of turbulent
	kinetic energy and dissipation are found in the impingement zone
	which decrease rapidly towards the exit of the CIJR. In the whole
	CIJR the turbulence is not in equilibrium. The strong mixing in the
	impingement zone leads to a rapid development of a monomodal PDF.
	Due to the special properties of the flow field, a bimodal PDF is
	generated in cross-sections downstream the impingement zone, that
	slowly relaxes under relaminarising conditions. The time required
	for meso-mixing is dominating the overall mixing performance.},

	The use of mathematical relationships to characterise distinct parts
	of the physiological behaviour of mammalian cells and the systematic

	iron ore concentrate, which is currently produced in large quantities
	in North America and elsewhere. This transformative technology is
	expected to allow significant energy saving and reduced CO2 emissions

	that iron of more than 95 % metallization can be obtained by reduction
	with hydrogen or a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in 2-7 s
	at temperatures of 1473-1823 K. The development of the technology
	has gone through the stages of proof-of-concept and small laboratory

  abstract = {A particle under a temperature gradient experiences a force toward
	the colder region if a particle is very small. This phenomenon is
	called thermophoresis, a mass transfer phenomenon induced by the
	temperature gradient. It is well known that the magnitude of the
	thermophoretic force depends on the size of particle and the temperature
	gradient. In addition, the magnitude of the thermophoretic force
	depends on various factors such as the ambient gas’s kinematic viscosity
	and thermal conductivity and the morphology of the particle. To understand
	thermophoresis in detail, the effects of these factors need to be
	evaluated. In this study, we accurately measured the thermophoretic
	velocity of aggregated particles in order to understand the effect
	of particle morphology. We used carbon black particles of well-defined
	aggregation parameters to systematically understand the effect of
	morphology. In addition, we introduced a new optical system to measure
	the velocity and the size of each particle simultaneously. Five different
	samples of carbon black particles with different aggregation parameters
	were used to systematically understand the effect of morphology.
	The measured thermophoretic velocities were almost proportional to
	ν∇T/T. The measured dimensionless thermophoretic velocities, UT/(ν∇T/T),
	were much larger than those expected based on the size of aggregates
	and rather close to those expected based on the primary particle
	size even when the size of aggregates are larger than 100 mm. This
	result infers that thermophoretic velocity of an aggregated particle
	is governed by the primary particle size. The dimensionless density,
	the ratio of the bulk density to the true density, which represents
	the overall packing degree of aggregate, is also found to have a
	significant effect on the thermophoretic behavior.},

  abstract  = {The engine combustion network (ECN) Spray A is modelled using the
	Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes-transported probability density function
	(RANS-TPDF) approach to validate the application of a new multiple
	mapping conditioning (MMC) mixing model to multiphase reactive flows.
	The composition TPDF equations are solved using a Lagrangian stochastic
	approach and the spray is modelled with a discrete particle approach.
	The model is first validated under non-reacting conditions (at 900 K)
	using experimental mixture-fraction data. Reactive simulations are
	then performed for three different ambient temperatures (800, 900,
	1100 K) and oxygen concentrations (13, 15, 21%) at an ambient density
	of 22.8 kg/m3. The MMC mixing model is compared with the interaction
	by exchange with the mean (IEM) mixing model. The ignition delay
	predictions are not sensitive to the mixing model and are predicted
	well by both the mixing models under all the tested ambient conditions.
	The IEM model overpredicts the flame lift-off length (FLOL) at high
	temperature and high oxygen conditions with a mixing constant Cϕ=2.
	The MMC model with Cϕ=2 and a target correlation coefficient rt=0.935
	between the mixture fraction and a reference variable used to condition
	mixing predicts good FLOL under all the conditions except 800 K.
	It is demonstrated that the lift-off length is controllable by changing
	the target correlation coefficient, while Cϕ and therefore the mixing
	fields are held fixed. In comparison to the MMC model, the IEM model
	predicts a higher variance of temperature conditioned on mixture
	fraction near the flame base owing to its lacking the property of
	localness. The mixing distance between the notional TPDF particles
	in the composition space is also higher with the IEM model and it
	is demonstrated that by changing rt, different levels of mixing locality
	can be achieved.},

	a modern, quantitative, visualization tool, has been applied to the
	characterization of the flow field in the impeller region of cell
	culture reactor vessels. The experimental system used here is a 250-mL
	microcarrier spinner vessel. The studies were conducted at three
	different agitation rates, 90, 150, and 210 rpm, corresponding to
	healthy, mildly damaging, and severely damaging shear intensities,
	respectively. The flow can be classified into three regions: a predominantly
	tangential (azimuthal) flow generated by the impeller; a trailing
	vortex region coming off the impeller tip; and a converging flow
	region close to the center of the vessel. The latter two are the
	regions of highest velocity gradients. Energy dissipation rates due
	to mean velocity gradients were also calculated to characterize the
	impeller stream. Local specific energy dissipation rates > 10,000
	erg/(cm3sec) · have been measured. It is proposed that the critical
	regions for microcarrier culture damage due to impeller hydrodynamics
	are the trailing vortex region and the high energy converging flow
	region. Graphical representation of the mean velocity flow fields
	and the distribution of energy dissipation rates in the impeller
	region are also presented here. The merits of using the dissipation
	function (measure of specific energy dissipation rate) as a possible
	scale-up parameter are also discussed. ? 1996 John Wiley & Sons,

	bioreactors. Microbial kinetics of Escherichia coli including flow
	metabolism was determined in lab-scale batch and fed-batch experiments.
	The effect of high substrate fluctuations on metabolism was quantified

	flow model based on the compartment model approach (CMA). The flow
	model was verified by mixing time experiments on aerated reactors
	mixed with multiple impellers at different regimes with liquid volumes
	8-22m3. The integral model, predicting local glucose, acetate and
	biomass concentrations in different parts of the reactor, was compared
	to three large-scale fermentations performed in two different reactors.
	If lab-scale kinetics was used, the biomass prediction overestimated
	the biomass concentration. Lab-scale kinetics modified by the results
	of scale-down experiments incorporating the effect of substrate fluctuations
	gave a rather satisfying description of biomass concentration. Glucose
	gradients in different parts of the reactor and acetate produced

	greater attention as a source of non-genetic heterogeneity, the effects
	of stochastic partitioning of cellular material during mitosis on
	population variability have not been researched to date. We examined
	self-renewing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which typically
	exhibit a dispersed distribution of the pluripotency marker NANOG.
	In conjunction with our experiments, a multiscale cell population
	balance equation (PBE) model was constructed accounting for transcriptional
	noise and stochastic partitioning at division as sources of population
	heterogeneity. Cultured hESCs maintained time-invariant profiles
	of size and NANOG expression and the data were utilized for parameter
	estimation. Contributions from both sources considered in this study
	were significant on the NANOG profile, although elimination of the
	gene expression noise resulted in greater changes in the dispersion
	of the NANOG distribution. Moreover, blocking of division by treating
	hESCs with nocodazole or colcemid led to a 39% increase in the average
	NANOG content and over 68% of the cells had higher NANOG level than
	the mean NANOG expression of untreated cells. Model predictions,
	which were in excellent agreement with these findings, revealed that
	stochastic partitioning accounted for 17% of the total noise in the
	NANOG profile of self-renewing hESCs. The computational framework
	developed in this study will aid in gaining a deeper understanding
	of how pluripotent stem/progenitor cells orchestrate processes such
	as gene expression and proliferation for maintaining their pluripotency
	or differentiating along particular lineages. Such models will be
	essential in designing and optimizing efficient differentiation strategies

  abstract = {Insight into the spatiotemporal evolution of particle size distribution
	(PSD) is very useful in many natural and engineering systems in which
	the multiphase fields are spatially inhomogeneous and complicated
	dynamic processes of particle population, e.g., coagulation between
	particles, occur with field-dependent rates. Traditional population
	balance modeling (PBM) is usually used to simulate spatially homogeneous
	dynamic processes, only obtaining the time evolution of PSD. In this
	paper, we presented an algorithm to predict the spatiotemporal evolution
	of PSD accounting for mutual coupling of particle population and
	hydrodynamics. The differentially-weighted Monte Carlo method for
	PBM is used to simulate coagulation behavior of particles in each
	grid that is considered to be spatially homogeneous, and the transport
	behavior of fluid and particles towards neighbor grids that are spatially
	inhomogeneous are described by general conservation equations of
	multiphase flows. The simulation strategy is based on the selection
	of a time step within which the fluid transport, the particle transport
	and the particle dynamics are uncoupled and then separately simulated.
	A limiting case of the coarse high-inertia particles whose motion
	is independent of surrounding fluid is chosen to validate the population
	balance-Monte Carlo (PBMC) method for the spatiotemporal evolution
	of PSD. The computational time is found to be less by a factor of
	10 compared to the direct numerical simulation (DNS), yielding reasonably
	closer predictions of spatiotemporal particle size distributions.},

Self-preserving distributions have been computed for agglomerates of various fractal dimensions. In the free-molecular regime, the self-preserving size distributions broaden as the fractal dimension decreases. In contrast, in the continuum regime, the distributions narrow with decreasing fractal dimension. The aggregate growth rate increases with decreasing fractal dimension of the colliding particles. This effect is more pronounced in the free-molecular than in the continuum regime. In the free-molecular regime, particles of low fractal dimension have larger cross-sectional area than particles of equal mass but with higher fractal dimension. The larger cross-sectional area per unit particle mass results in a direct increase in the coagulation rate. In the continuum regime, the effect of enhanced collision area is reduced by the increased drag of the agglomerates.},

  abstract  = {Epidemiological studies continue to indicate associations between exposure to increased concentrations of ambient fine and ultrafine particles and adverse health effects in susceptible individuals. The ultrafine particle fraction in the ambient atmosphere seems to play a specific role. Yet, the dosimetry (including deposition patterns in the respiratory tract and, particularly, the biokinetic fate of ultrafine particles) is not fully understood. In contrast to fine particles, inhaled ultrafine particles seem to follow different routes in the organism. Cardiovascular effects observed in epidemiological studies triggered the discussion on enhanced translocation of ultrafine particles from the respiratory epithelium towards circulation and subsequent target organs, such as heart, liver, and brain, eventually causing adverse effects on cardiac function and blood coagulation, as well as on functions of the central nervous system. Current knowledge on systemic translocation of ultrafine particles in humans and animal models is reviewed. Additionally, an estimate of accumulating particle numbers in secondary target organs during chronic exposure is extrapolated from long-term translocation data obtained from rats. Toxicological studies aim to provide the biological plausibility of health effects of ultrafine particles and to identify cascades of mechanisms that are causal for the gradual transition from the physiological status towards pathophysiologcal alterations and eventually chronic disease. Considering the interaction between insoluble ultrafine particles and biological systems (such as body fluids, proteins, and cells), there still are gaps in the current knowledge on how ultrafine particles may cause adverse reactions. This paper reviews the current concept of interactions between insoluble ultrafine particles and biological systems.},

  abstract = {A metric for the assessment of health effects of diesel exhaust particles is proposed and a methodology to determine it from experimental data is presented. The metric treats separately the emitted volatile and non-volatile mass fractions. The appropriate metric for health related effects of the non-volatile mass fraction (primarily soot), termed the physical effect, is taken to be the particle (active) surface area distribution. The corresponding metric of the volatile mass fraction (unburned hydrocarbons, sulfates, nitrates), termed the chemical effect, is taken to be the volatile mass concentration distribution of the nucleation mode and the mass concentration distribution of the condensed volatiles on the accumulation mode. The latter is proportional to distribution of the (active) surface area concentration of the accumulation mode. A methodology to derive the distributions (metric) from filter-based mass and number distributions measurements is suggested. Nine experimental particle number distribution, emitted by light duty Euro 1, 3 and 4 vehicles, with and without diesel particulate filters or catalysts, at different speeds and using different fuels, are analyzed to determine characteristic volatile mass and non-volatile surface area concentration distributions. These distributions become the required input distributions for lung deposition calculations, thereby defining the appropriate metric to estimate health effects of diesel exhaust particles.},

  abstract = {Deposition of diesel exhaust particles in the human respiratory tract is calculated in terms of the equivalent mobility diameter while accounting for the aggregate's number of primary spherules, Np, and its mass mobility fractal dimension. The size and shape of the soot particles studied correspond to emissions from diesel engines under different loading conditions. The aggregate's morphology, characterized by the aggregate mass mobility fractal dimension Dfm, is shown to significantly affect its age- and ventilation-specific deposition patterns in the human respiratory tract and hence, the exposure experienced by the receptor. Reporting respiratory tract deposition of diesel soot solely in terms of the aggregate mobility diameter, which lumps together size and shape, precludes a close look at deposition patterns of real particles and does not provide a complete picture for exposure inference. For sedentary adults, soot aggregates tend to deposit in the pulmonary region, with large open aggregates depositing to a greater extent than large compact aggregates. In most cases, and for open structured aggregates in particular, the aggregate deposition exceeds the deposition of their equivalent volume spheres. Whereas adults experience higher total respiratory tract soot deposition, infants are more susceptible to proximal deposition of open aggregates (Dfm<2.2). For an adult performing intense activity both the tracheobronchial and the alveolar deposition fractions are smaller than at rest, whereas extrathoracic deposition increases during intense activity. Alveolar deposition of soot aggregates is evident mainly during rest and is more pronounced for small aggregates (Np<50).},

The emitted volatile and non-volatile mass fractions were treated separately as the corresponding biological response in the human respiratory tract differs. The health related effects of the volatile mass fraction, referred to as the chemical effect, were associated with the deposited volatile mass. The deposited volatile mass depends on the total emitted volatile mass concentration, on its distribution (mass median diameter of nucleation mode and surface area median of the accumulation mode), and on the ratio of the volatile mass in the nucleation and accumulation modes. The effect of the non-volatile mass fraction, referred to as the physical effect, was associated with the surface area distribution of the accumulation mode. The deposited surface area of the non-volatile fraction depends on its emitted concentration and on the surface area median diameter of the size distribution. The calculations suggest the importance of selecting the appropriate distribution (surface, volatile or non-volatile mass) for an assessment of the health effects of diesel exhaust particles, and the importance of combined particulate mass and number distribution measurements.},

  abstract = {Diesel emissions are a major contributor to combustion-generated airborne ambient particles. To understand the role of diesel particulate emissions on health effects, it is important to predict the actual particulate dose deposited in the human respiratory tract, with respect to number, surface area and mass. This is complicated by the agglomerate nature of some of these particles. In this study the respiratory tract deposition fraction in the size range 10-500nm, was determined for 10 healthy volunteers during both idling and transient engine running conditions of a heavy duty diesel engine. The aerosol was characterized with respect to both chemical and physical properties including size resolved particle effective density. The dominating part of the emitted particles had an agglomerate structure. For those formed during transient running conditions, the relationship between particle mass and mobility diameter could be described by a power law function. This was not the case during idling, most likely because of volatile compounds condensing on the agglomerates. The respiratory tract particle deposition revealed large intra-subject variability with some subjects receiving a dose that was twice as high as that of others, when exposed to the same particle concentration. Associations were found between total deposited fractions (TDF), and breathing pattern. There was a difference between the idling and transient cycle with TDF being higher with respect to number during idling. The measured size-dependent deposition fraction of the agglomerated exhaust particles from both running conditions was nearly identical and closely resembled that of spherical hydrophobic particles, if plotted as a function of mobility diameter. Thus, for the size range covered, the mobility diameter could well describe the diameter-dependent particle respiratory tract deposition probability, regardless of the agglomeration state of the particles. Whilst mobility diameter well describes the deposition fraction, more information about particle characteristics is needed to convert this to volume equivalent diameter or estimate dose with respect to surface area or mass. A methodology is presented and applied to calculate deposited dose by surface area and mass of agglomerated particles. The methodology may be useful in similar studies estimating dose to the lung, deposition onto cell cultures and in animal studies.},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies observed associations between airborne particles and cardio-vascular disease. Questions, however, remain as to which size of the inhalable particles (coarse, fine, or ultrafine) exerts the most significant impact on health. Methods For this retrospective study, data of the total number of 23,741 emergency service calls, registered between February 2002 and January 2003 in the City of Leipzig, were analysed, identifying 5326 as being related to cardiovascular incidences. Simultaneous particle exposure was determined for the particle sizes classes <100nm (UFP), <2.5μm (PM2.5) and <10μm (PM10). We used a time resolution of 1day for both parameters, emergency calls and exposure. Results Within the group of cardiovascular diseases, the diagnostic category of hypertensive crisis showed a significant association with particle exposure. The significant effect on hypertensive crisis was found for particles with a size of <100nm in diameter and starting with a lag of 2days after exposure. No consistent influence could be observed for PM2.5 and PM10. The Odds Ratios on hypertensive crisis were significant for the particle size <100nm in diameter from day 2 post exposure OR=1.06 (95%CI: 1.02-1.10, p=0.002) up to day 7 OR=1.05 (95%CI 1.02-1.09, p=0.005). Conclusion Ultrafine particles affect cardiovascular disease adversely, particularly hypertensive crises. Their effect is significant compared with PM2.5 and PM10. It appears necessary, from a public health point of view, to consider regulating this type of particles using appropriate measurands as particle number.},

  abstract = {The numerical simulation of the soot particle size distribution in flames is addressed by solving the balance equations for total number density and the probability density function of particle sizes, leading to a hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method for solving soot population balance equation. Well established models are introduced in these equations for the chemistry of PAH in ethylene combustion, for particle nucleation, growth, agglomeration and oxidation. These closures are combined with a stochastic approach, which drives the evolution of a fixed number of computational particles used to solve for the particle size distribution with a control of agglomeration and numerical roundoff error through a fixed sectional discretisation. A laminar sooting flame is simulated to compare the results against measurements and previous numerical simulations, confirming the validity of the novel approach in terms of accuracy and CPU efficiency. The relation between the mobility diameter, measured in the experiments, and the equivalent sphere diameter, introduced in the modeling, is discussed under this novel numerical framework. The influence of the fractal particle shape on the simulated particle size distribution is explored. Finally, Particle Size Distributions obtained from the hybrid method are compared to the ones obtained with a representative fixed-sectional method.},

At each time step, the nucleation and growth terms of the PBE are solved using high resolution finite volume method (HRFV), and then the breakage term is solved using the MC approach. This integrated approach is especially advantageous for solving multi-dimensional PBE involving nucleation, growth, and breakage events. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by solving both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) PBE from published literature. Also, a set of seeded batch cooling crystallization of plate-like pyrazinamide crystals were performed in presence of ultrasound (US) and the proposed hybrid solution scheme was used successfully to model and simulate this system characterised by 2D PBE.},

  abstract = {Stochastic simulation of population balance equations (PBEs) is robust and flexible; however, it exhibits intrinsic stochastic errors which decreases at a very slow rate when increasing the computational resolution. Generally, these stochastic methods can be classified into two groups: (i) the classical Gillespie method and (ii) weighted flow algorithm. An analytical relationship is derived for the first time to connect the variances in these two groups. It also provides a detailed analysis of the resampling process, which has not been given appropriate attention previously. It is found that resampling has a profound effect on the numerical precision. Moreover, by comparing the time evolutions between systematic errors (i.e., errors in the mean value) and stochastic errors (i.e., variances), it is found that the former grows considerably faster than the latter; thus, systematic errors eventually dominate. The present findings facilitate the choice of the most suitable stochastic method for a specific PBE a priori in order to balance numerical precision and efficiency.},

Therefore, the RBM is considered as a meshless method. The RBM is convenient and suitable for complex problems involving nucleation, growth, breakage and aggregation phenomena. The method provides naturally a continuously differentiable, or “smooth”, solution and avoids solving ill-conditioned problems. The numerical solutions are validated analytically and numerically using different case-studies for uniform stirred-tank. For these examples, 20 collocation points were found to be enough to achieve accurate predictions.

  abstract = {A numerical scheme is proposed for the solution of population balance equations that describe the growth of faceted crystals. Therefore, two issues are discussed. First, a numerical scheme for solution of high dimensional population balance equations is proposed. The scheme is based on Monte Carlo integration for the integral distribution properties (number, area, volume) combined with the method of characteristics. Samples’ points are initially obtained from an arbitrary probability distribution via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The evolution of these sample points is subsequently computed using the method of characteristics, while the sample points themselves are the basis of the Monte Carlo integration of the population to obtain e.g. total crystal volume to close the mass balance. The theoretical background of the Monte Carlo integration allows us to estimate the error introduced in the mass balance depending on a particular choice of sampling points. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified for an analytically solvable 3-dimensional population. That case study is also employed to demonstrate that an adequate choice of the probability distribution for the generation of the initial sample points can improve the accuracy without increasing the computational effort. The second issue that must simultaneously be considered comprises the disappearance of faces during growth. Such conditions create a constraint for each face distance, measured from a chosen origin, which, prior to the disappearance of that face, had freely evolved according to its growth rate. This constraint is defined for general faceted crystals, and a procedure is proposed to correct the growth rate so that the constraint can be maintained in dynamic simulations. The application of this procedure is demonstrated in a second case study that simulates a 7-dimensional population balance equation.},

The resulting mathematical models represent high dimensional partial integro-differential equations which are rarely solvable analytically. As alternative to classical numerical solution methods which are not well suited for efficient solution, we propose a hybrid simulation algorithm in this contribution.

While it is a sustainability enabler, for instance through lightweight design, magnetic devices, and efficient turbines, its primary production is not. Iron is reduced from ores by carbon, causing 30% of the global CO2 emissions in manufacturing, qualifying it as the largest single industrial greenhouse gas emission source. Hydrogen is thus attractive as alternative reductant. Although this reaction has been studied for decades, its kinetics is not well understood, particularly during the wüstite reduction step which is much slower than hematite reduction. Some rate-limiting factors of this reaction are determined by the microstructure and local chemistry of the ores. Here, we report on a multi-scale structure and composition analysis of iron reduced from hematite with pure H2, reaching down to near-atomic scale. During reduction a complex pore- and microstructure evolves, due to oxygen loss and non-volume conserving phase transformations. The microstructure after reduction is an aggregate of nearly pure iron crystals, containing inherited and acquired pores and cracks. We observe several types of lattice defects that accelerate mass transport as well as several chemical impurities (Na, Mg, Ti, V) within the Fe in the form of oxide islands that were not reduced. With this study, we aim to open the perspective in the field of carbon-neutral iron production from macroscopic processing towards better understanding of the underlying microscopic transport and reduction mechanisms and kinetics.},

  abstract = {Iron- and steelmaking is the largest single industrial CO2 emitter, accounting for 6.5% of all CO2 emissions on the planet. This fact challenges the current technologies to achieve carbon-lean steel production and to align with the requirement of a drastic reduction of 80% in all CO2 emissions by around 2050. Thus, alternative reduction technologies have to be implemented for extracting iron from its ores. The hydrogen-based direct reduction has been explored as a sustainable route to mitigate CO2 emissions, where the reduction kinetics of the intermediate oxide product FexO (wüstite) into iron is the rate-limiting step of the process. The total reaction has an endothermic net energy balance. Reduction based on a hydrogen plasma may offer an attractive alternative. Here, we present a study about the reduction of hematite using hydrogen plasma. The evolution of both, chemical composition and phase transformations was investigated in several intermediate states. We found that hematite reduction kinetics depends on the balance between the initial input mass and the arc power. For an optimized input mass-arc power ratio, complete reduction was obtained within 15 min of exposure to the hydrogen plasma. In such a process, the wüstite reduction is also the rate-limiting step towards complete reduction. Nonetheless, the reduction reaction is exothermic, and its rates are comparable with those found in hydrogen-based direct reduction. Micro- and nanoscale chemical and microstructure analysis revealed that the gangue elements partition to the remaining oxide regions, probed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atom probe tomography (APT). Si-enrichment was observed in the interdendritic fayalite domains, at the wüstite/iron hetero-interfaces and in the oxide particles inside iron. With proceeding reduction, however, such elements are gradually removed from the samples so that the final iron product is nearly free of gangue-related impurities. Our findings provide microstructural and atomic-scale insights into the composition and phase transformations occurring during iron ore reduction by hydrogen plasma, propelling better understanding of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetic barriers of this essential process.},

The accelerated demand for structural (that is, load-bearing) alloys in key sectors such as energy, construction, safety and transportation is resulting in predicted production growth rates of up to 200 per cent until 2050. Yet most of these materials require a lot of energy when extracted and manufactured and these processes emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and pollution. Here we review methods of improving the direct sustainability of structural metals, in areas including reduced-carbon-dioxide primary production, recycling, scrap-compatible alloy design, contaminant tolerance of alloys and improved alloy longevity. We discuss the effectiveness and technological readiness of individual measures and also show how novel structural materials enable improved energy efficiency through their reduced mass, higher thermal stability and better mechanical properties than currently available alloys.},

  abstract = {A fast Monte Carlo methodology for particulate processes is introduced. The proposed methodology combines concepts from discrete population balance equations and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of chemical kinetics to construct a new jump Markov model that approximates the population balance dynamics. The Markov model consists of a definition of a new type of reaction channel, in which the reaction product is a stochastic process by itself. One feature of this model is that, although a coarse view of the process is taken, it still conserves the history of individual particles. This is a very important aspect for effective modeling of multivariate models, especially when part of the goal is to study the evolution of the internal states of the particles (i.e., composition, phase behavior, etc.). Numerical experiments show that this algorithm can improve the computational load of the exact method by orders of magnitude without sacrificing computational accuracy. The methodology is useful especially in stochastic optimization applications where many function calls (simulations) are required. Possible applications are optimization and dynamic optimization using an artificial chemical process algorithm, genetic algorithm, or simulated annealing among others.},

The PEMC method is a “constructed” jump Markov model that approximates the dynamics of the original particulate process without losing a detailed description of individual particles. The PEMC method is integrated using the stochastic simulation algorithm, which is exact in time. A natural extension of the PEMC algorithm is to consider a coarse-graining strategy for the time to further accelerate the MC simulation. In this work, the τ-leap method is adapted to the PEMC. It is shown that when the τ-parameter is selected properly, the τ-PEMC can also give accurate results with faster computational speed than the PEMC method. Furthermore, similar to the PEMC, the dynamic of complex intra-particle phenomena can be represented accurately. Numerical experiments show that this algorithm can improve the computational load of the exact method by orders of magnitude without sacrificing computational accuracy.

We present the Binned Algorithm for particle removal processes and analyze its performance with application to the atmospherically relevant process of aerosol dry deposition. We show that the Binned Algorithm can dramatically improve the efficiency of particle removals, particularly for low removal rates, and that computational cost is reduced without introducing additional error. In simulations of aerosol particle removal by dry deposition in atmospherically relevant conditions, we demonstrate about 50-times increase in algorithm efficiency.},

  abstract = {Multicomponent crystallisation is a widely studied technique in pharmaceutical chemistry to enhance physical properties of API’s such as solubility, stability and bioavailability without chemically modifying the drug moiety itself. Methods to produce multicomponent crystals are varied with solution crystallisation being the predominant method. Crystal morphologies also influence an API’s properties with needle shaped crystals dissolving slower and possessing poor flow properties compared to a more equant block shape. In this paper, we discuss the preparation of co-crystals and co-crystal salts of two poorly soluble drugs, pyrimethamine and diflunisal. In particular, we compare production of multicomponent crystals via cosublimation with the more common methods of mechanical grinding and solution crystallisation. Samples are sublimed on a laboratory scale from both ends of standard 15 × 160 mm test tubes sealed under vacuum with two heaters were used to equalize the sublimation rates of the components. We show that a range of multicomponent pharmaceutical crystals can be prepared that are not accessible via solution crystallisation, including polymorphs and ansolvates. In addition to binary systems, ternary crystals can also be obtained via this technique. Various diflunisal co-crystals crystallise as thin needles and we describe the use of tailor-made additives to obtain unprecedented morphology control of gas phase crystal growth. Finally, we discuss the formation of co-crystal salts in the absence of solvent. Salt formation was observed to occur during gas phase crystallisations in accordance with the pKa rule of 3 and modelling studies were carried out to understand the nature of proton transfer in these crystals in the absence of a solvent.},

One major problem is the computational expense of coupling a standard discretized population balance (DPB) with a CFD code, as this approach requires the solution of an intractably large number of transport equations. In this work the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) is tested for size-dependent growth and aggregation. The QMOM is validated by comparison with both Monte Carlo simulations and analytical solutions using several functional forms for the aggregation kernel. Moreover, model predictions are compared with a DPB to compare accuracy, computational time, and the number of scalars involved. Analysis of the relative performance of various methods for treating aggregation provides readers with useful information about the range of application and possible limitations.},

  abstract = {A sectional scheme for soot formation is combined with a novel model for coagulation efficiency based on the thermal rebound concept and involves the minimisation of the Lennard-Jones potential energy between two colliding particles. Here, a novel generalisation of the interaction potential well depth is formulated for particles of any size or material composition that contains a free parameter λ which is related to the soot particle void fraction. A simplification that expresses the coagulation rate in an Arrhenius-like form is proposed so that the entire gas-phase and soot kinetics can be easily coupled and integrated using existing chemical kinetics solvers. The model is included in the sectional scheme, which accounts for nucleation, surface growth/oxidation, coagulation and fragmentation, and is validated against experimental data for a series of ethylene burner stabilised stagnation (BSS) premixed flames and a methane laminar coflow diffusion flame. The soot kinetics is discretised into lumped species according to soot particle size (or number of carbon atoms) and the soot evolution follows a 23-step abstract reaction scheme that is a reduced form of an existing multisectional soot kinetics scheme (Sirignano et al., Energy & Fuels 27, 2013). Overall, the model predictions produce a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data but there is considerable sensitivity to λ. In particular, λ has a strong effect on the soot particle size distribution (PSD) in the BSS flames. λ=1 or 1.25 lead to an overprediction of large particle concentrations but result in the correct transition to a bimodal PSD as the stagnation plate separation distance increases, whereas λ=2 is found to produce accurate predictions for nascent soot but suppresses the transition to a bimodal PSD. In the methane coflow diffusion flame increasing λ reduces the soot volume fraction but the predictions are also found to be very sensitive to the chosen numerical threshold for the lower soot size detection limit and results are presented for 2 nm and 7 nm thresholds for comparison against both laser-based and probe-based experimental data.},

The proposed process is based on the flash reduction of iron ore concentrate using a gaseous reagent, such as hydrogen, syngas, natural gas or a combination of thereof. A process flow sheet of the proposed ironmaking process using purchased hydrogen was constructed and then simulations were performed at several potential operating conditions. Ironmaking was simulated using two different process configurations. The simulation results show that the required fresh hydrogen would increase with higher excess driving force and operating temperature, but not greatly when hydrogen is preheated. Compared with the average blast furnace process, the proposed process would reduce energy consumption by 57 - 60%, using the higher heating value of hydrogen (71 ? 73%, if the lower heating value is used), when hydrogen and coal are considered as the starting materials in the respective processes. The economic feasibility analysis using net present value (NPV) indicates that the proposed process could be economically feasible at elevated hot metal prices and/or if reduction in carbon dioxide emissions has a significant value in a cap and trade scenario.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to develop a population balance approach for modelling soot formation that distinguishes between coalescence and aggregation and accounts for finite-rate fusing of primary particles within aggregates, while providing a numerically accurate description of primary particle surface growth and oxidation within aggregates. To this end, the recently developed conservative finite volume sectional method for the solution of the population balance equation (PBE) due to Liu and Rigopoulos (2019, Combust. Flame 205, 506-521) is extended to a two-PBE approach that allows for a more accurate modelling of primary particle surface growth and oxidation and furthermore involves a timescale for the fusing of primary particles. The accuracy of the numerical method is first tested by calculating the self-preserving distributions of aggregates with varying fractal dimension. Subsequently, the one-PBE and two-PBE approaches are coupled with CFD and applied to the simulation of the Santoro laminar non-premixed co-flow sooting flame. The results show that both approaches can provide good prediction of the soot volume fraction, but the two-PBE approach yields a significant improvement in the prediction of soot morphology. At present, the information available for modelling the gradual fusing of soot primary particles is based on experiments on silica and titania nanoparticles, and therefore a comprehensive study of the impact of the sintering model parameters is conducted. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the predictive potential of the one-PBE and two-PBE approaches.},

The population balance equation (PBE) is solved via a discretisation method employing a composite grid that provides sufficient detail over the wide range of particle sizes reached during the precipitation process. The coupled DNS/PBE approach captures accurately the strong interaction between the dynamics of turbulent mixing and particle formation processes. It also allows the calculation of the particle size distribution (PSD) of the product and enables an investigation on how it is controlled by turbulent mixing.

  abstract = {A novel ironmaking process is under development at the University of Utah to produce iron directly from iron oxides concentrates by the gas-solid flash reaction using gaseous fuels and reductants. This process will reduce energy consumption and minimize carbon dioxide emissions. Having investigated the hydrogen reduction kinetics of magnetite and hematite concentrate particles relevant to the novel flash ironmaking process, the carbon monoxide reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate particles (average particle size 21 µm) was determined in the temperature range 1473 K to 1623 K (1200 °C to 1350 °C) under various carbon monoxide partial pressures. At 1623 K (1350 °C) and residence time 5 seconds, the reduction degree of hematite concentrate particles was more than 90 pct under a pure carbon monoxide. This is slower than reduction by hydrogen but still significant, indicating that CO will contribute to the reduction of hematite concentrate in the flash process. The kinetics of CO reduction separately from hydrogen is important for understanding and analyzing the complex kinetics of hematite reduction by the H2 + CO mixtures. The nucleation and growth rate equation with the Avrami parameter n = 1.0 adequately described the carbon monoxide reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate particles. The reduction rate is of 1st order with respect to the partial pressure of carbon monoxide and the activation energy of the reaction was 231 kJ/mol, indicating strong temperature dependence. The following complete rate equation was developed that can satisfactorily predict the carbon monoxide reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate particles and is suitable for the design of a flash reactor $$ \frac{{{\text{d}}X}}{{{\text{d}}t}} = 1.91 \times 10^{7} \times e^{{\frac{ - 231000}{\text{RT}}}} \times \left( {p{\text{CO}} - \frac{{p{\text{CO}}_{2} }}{K}} \right) \times (1 - X), $$where X is the fraction of oxygen removed from iron oxide, R is 8.314 J/mol K, T is in K, p is in atm, and t is in seconds.},

  abstract = {Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) present a key therapeutic cellular intervention for use in cell and gene therapy (CGT) applications due to their immunomodulatory properties and multi-differentiation capability. Some of the indications where hMSCs have demonstrated pre-clinical or clinical efficacy to improve outcomes are cartilage repair, acute myocardial infarction, graft versus host disease, Crohn’s disease and arthritis. The current engineering challenge is to produce hMSCs at an affordable price and at a commercially-relevant scale whilst minimising process variability and manual, human operations. By employing bioreactors and microcarriers (due to the adherent nature of hMSCs), it is expected that production costs would decrease due to improved process monitoring and control leading to better consistency and process efficiency, and enabling economies of scale. This approach will result in off the shelf (allogeneic) hMSC-based products becoming more accessible and affordable. Importantly, cell quality, including potency, must be maintained during the bioreactor manufacturing process. This review aims to examine the various factors to be considered when developing a hMSC manufacturing process using microcarriers and bioreactors and their potential impact on the final product. As concluding remarks, gaps in the current literature and potential future areas of research are also discussed.},

In this study, we have demonstrated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the ability of bone marrow-derived hMSCs to migrate from one microcarrier to another, and, to populate fresh microcarriers when added into suspension culture. Additionally, we have shown that compared to inoculating a culture with cells in free suspension, inoculating 10% of near-confluent microcarriers from an initial seed microcarrier culture resulted in an increase in the cell growth rate and overall cell yield and a significant reduction in the lag phase. These findings were consistent across cells from three different BM-hMSC donors and across different culture medium conditions, foetal bovine serum-supplemented medium, human platelet lysate-supplemented medium and serum-free medium. This new cells-on-beads inoculation method is an effective means of process intensification with the potential to decrease manufacturing times and potentially costs of hMSC-based therapies.},

Such cells must be grown attached to surfaces and for large scale production, it is shown that stirred bioreactors containing ~200 μm particles (microcarriers) can provide such a surface. It is also shown that the just suspended condition, agitator speed NJS, provides a satisfactory condition for cell growth by minimizing the specific energy dissipation rate, εT, in the bioreactor whilst still meeting the oxygen demand of the cells. For the cells to be used for therapeutic purposes, they must be detached from the microcarriers before being cryopreserved. A strategy based on a short period (~7 min) of very high εT, based on theories of secondary nucleation, is effective at removing >99% cells. Once removed, the cells are smaller than the Kolmogorov scale of turbulence and hence not damaged. This approach is shown to be successful for culture and detachment in 4 types of stirred bioreactors from 15 mL to 5 L.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Adult stem cells, or mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), are of great potential for cell therapy and tissue-engineering applications. However, for therapeutic use, these cells need to be isolated from tissue or a biopsy and efficiently expanded, as they cannot be harvested in sufficient quantities from the body. In our opinion, efficient expansion of MSCs can be achieved in a microcarrier-based cultivation system. This study selected a suitable microcarrier for human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (HBMSCs), optimized cell-seeding strategies by varying serum concentrations, and optimized dynamic expansion of the HBMSCs in a microcarrier-based spinner flask cultivation system by applying various feeding regimes. Cytodex 1 microcarriers in combination with a low-serum concentration (0?5%) in the medium resulted in the highest seeding efficiency for the HBMSCs. Subsequently, significant expansion of the HBMSCs on these carriers has been observed. The highest number of HBMSCs population doublings (4.8 doublings) was obtained by a combination of 50% medium refreshment combined with addition of 30% medium containing microcarriers every 3 days. Exponential cell growth was observed for at least 9 days after seeding, provided that sufficient nutrients (such as glucose) were present, metabolite concentrations (such as ammonia) were kept below growth-inhibitory concentrations and adequate surface area was present for the cells. After dynamic expansion of the HBMSCs, the cells retained their differentiation potential and their cell surface markers, indicating that HBMSCs expansion on Cytodex 1 microcarriers did not alter the phenotypic properties of the cells.

  abstract  = {Better quantitative understanding of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) metabolism is needed to identify, understand, and subsequently optimize the processes in expansion of hMSCs in vitro. For this purpose, we analyzed growth of hMSCs in vitro with a mathematical model based on the mass balances for viable cell numbers, glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate. The mathematical modeling had two aims: (1) to estimate kinetic parameters of important metabolites for hMSC monolayer cultures, and (2) to quantitatively assess assumptions on growth of hMSCs. Two cell seeding densities were used to investigate growth and metabolism kinetics of MSCs from three human donors. We analyzed growth up to confluency and used metabolic assumptions described in literature. Results showed a longer initial phase, a slower growth rate, and a higher glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate metabolic rates at the lower cell seeding density. Higher metabolic rates could be induced by a lower contact inhibition effect when seeding at 100?cells/cm2 than when seeding at 1000?cells/cm2. In addition, parameter estimation describing kinetics of hMSCs in culture, depending on the seeding density, showed doubling times in the order of 17?32?h, specific glucose consumption in the order of 1.25???10?1 to 3.77???10?1pmol/cell/h, specific lactate production in the order of 2.48???10?1 to 7.67???10?1?pmol/cell/h, specific glutamine production in the order of 7.04???10?3 to 2.27?pmol/cell/h, and specific glutamate production in the order of 4.87???10?1 to 23.4?pmol/cell/h. Lactate-to-glucose yield ratios confirmed that hMSCs use glucose via anaerobic glycolysis. In addition, glutamine and glutamate metabolic shifts were identified that could be important for understanding growth of hMSCs in vitro. This study showed that the mathematical modeling approach supports quantitative analysis of important mechanisms in proliferation of hMSCs in vitro.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The low bone marrow (BM) MSC titers demand a fast ex vivo expansion process to meet the clinically relevant cell dosage. Attending to the low oxygen tension of BM in vivo, we studied the influence of hypoxia on human BM MSC proliferation kinetics and metabolism. Human BM MSC cultured under 2% (hypoxia) and 20% O2 (normoxia) were characterized in terms of proliferation, cell division kinetics and metabolic patterns. BM MSC cultures under hypoxia displayed an early start of the exponential growth phase, and cell numbers obtained at each time point throughout culture were consistently higher under low O2, resulting in a higher fold increase after 12 days under hypoxia (40?±?10 vs. 30?±?6). Cell labeling with PKH26 allowed us to determine that after 2 days of culture, a significant higher cell number was already actively dividing under 2% compared to 20% O2 and BM MSC expanded under low oxygen tension displayed consistently higher percentages of cells in the latest generations (generations 4?6) until the 5th day of culture. Cells under low O2 presented higher specific consumption of nutrients, especially early in culture, but with lower specific production of inhibitory metabolites. Moreover, 2% O2 favored CFU-F expansion, while maintaining BM MSC characteristic immunophenotype and differentiative potential. Our results demonstrated a more efficient BM MSC expansion at 2% O2, compared to normoxic conditions, associated to an earlier start of cellular division and supported by an increase in cellular metabolism efficiency towards the maximization of cell yield for application in clinical settings.

  abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) emerge as promising tools for tissue engineering, cell therapy, and drug screening. Their potential use in clinical applications requires the efficient production of differentiated cells at large scale. Glucose, amino acid, and oxygen metabolism play a key role in MSC and PSC expansion and differentiation. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of stem cell metabolism for reprogramming, self-renewal, and lineage commitment. From the reported data, efficient expansion of stem cells has been found to rely on glycolysis, while during differentiation stem cells shift their metabolic pathway to oxidative phosphorylation. During reprogramming, the reverse metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis has been observed. As a consequence, the demands for glucose and oxygen vary upon different phases of stem cell production. Accurate understanding of stem cell metabolism is critical for the rational design of culture parameters such as oxygen tension and feeding regime in bioreactors towards efficient integrated reprogramming, expansion, and differentiation processes at large scale.},

However, for autologous (patient-specific) and allogeneic (off-the-shelf) hMSC-based therapies, in vitro expansion is necessary prior to the clinical application in order to achieve the required cell numbers. Safe, reproducible, and economic in vitro expansion of hMSCs for autologous and allogeneic therapies can be problematic because the cell material is restricted and the cells are sensitive to environmental changes. It is beneficial to collect detailed information on the hydrodynamic conditions and cell growth behavior in a bioreactor system, in order to develop a so called “Digital Twin” of the cultivation system and expansion process. Numerical methods, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which has become widely used in the biotech industry for studying local characteristics within bioreactors or kinetic growth modelling, provide possible solutions for such tasks.},

In this study, we investigated the amino acid metabolism of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), with focus on two questions: Which amino acids are consumed and/or secreted by hMSCs and at what rates? To answer these questions, hMSCs were cultured on tissue culture plastic and in a bioreactor, and their amino acid profile was analyzed. The results showed that the kinetics of hMSCs growth and amino acid metabolism were significantly higher for hMSCs in tissue culture plastic than in the bioreactor. Despite differences in culture conditions, 8 essential and 6 nonessential amino acids were consumed by hMSCs in both tissue culture plastic and bioreactor cultures. Glutamine was the most consumed amino acid with significantly higher rates than for any other amino acid. The metabolism of nonessential amino acids by hMSCs deviated significantly from that of other cell lines. The secretion of alanine, glycine, glutamate, and ornithine by hMSCs showed that there is a strong overflow metabolism that can be due to the high concentrations of amino acids provided in the medium. In addition, the data showed that there is a metabolic pattern for proliferating hMSCs, which can contribute to the design of medium without animal serum for stem cells. Further, this study shows how to implement amino acid rates and metabolic principles in three-dimensional stem cell biology.},

However, some cells as animal or human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) adhered on microcarriers, are reputed sensitive to hydromechanical stresses arising from stirring. Many publications, especially using Computational Fluid Dynamics, characterize spatial fields of velocity and turbulence inside bioreactors but the exposure frequency to these stresses is never taken into account in the case of animal cell culture bioreactor description. To fill this gap, this study used both CFD Reynolds-Averaged and Large-Eddy Simulations to characterize the hydrodynamics inside 250mL mini-bioreactors, which is a relevant volume for hMSC cultures. Five impeller geometries were studied. From the velocity and turbulence fields calculated, an energy dissipation/circulation function, related to both frequency and intensity of potentially damaging hydrodynamic events for the cells, was determined for various operating conditions. Based on the simulation results, the marine propeller operating in up-pumping mode seems to be the most adapted condition, since it exhibits a low frequency of exposure to an acceptable intensity of the turbulent dissipation rate. From a general point of view, the new methodology proposed should be used in the future to screen the most adapted bioreactor geometry to biological constraints.},

  abstract = {Dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is a key parameter in a number of chemical and biochemical processes. In stirred tank, its overall value is readily estimated; however its distribution is far from homogeneous. The experimental determination of dissipation rate is difficult and often limited to small regions of a reactor. Therefore, CFD appears to be a useful tool to estimate the distribution of the turbulence dissipation rate. In this work, two kinds of simulation have been performed: a simulation based on the URANS equations and a Large Eddy Simulation with the Smagorinski subgrid scale model. The aims of the present paper are (1) to compare URANS and LES simulations to PIV data in terms of velocity, kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate and (2) to study the influence of the constant in the subgrid scale model used in LES. In term of mean velocity, URANS simulation and especially LES are in good agreement with PIV experiments. In term of total kinetic energy, both simulations also give good results; however URANS simulation fails to predict the repartition of total kinetic energy between its periodic and turbulent components in the vicinity of the impeller. The mean velocity and the kinetic energy are shown to be independent of the value of the constant CS in the Smagorinski model. The overall dissipation rate is well predicted by URANS simulation but not its distribution in the impeller stream. For LES, the amplitude of local and overall dissipation rate is shown to be strongly dependent of the value of the constant CS. However, its distribution in the stream is similar regardless of the value of CS and best reproduced than by the URANS simulation.},

The turbulent flow structure and the mixing process in a bioreactor stirred by an axial Mixel TT impeller is characterized by PIV and tracer experiments. Comparison between experimental and numerical data shows that the CFD-based compartment model is able to reproduce accurately the spatial heterogeneities inside the bioreactor. The trajectory of a small tracer particle which perfectly follows the fluid flow is measured by optical trajectography. It is then simulated by a stochastic model which is either based on an homogeneous or on an inhomogeneous Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Comparison of residence and circulation time distributions in three zones defined inside the bioreactor shows that the inhomogeneous CTMC model predicts with an excellent accuracy the particle trajectories inside the bioreactor. The modeling approach proposed here could be an useful tool to design scale-down bioreactors in order to reproduce at lab-scale the stress levels encountered in large-scale production bioreactors and to characterize and compare different bioreactor configurations.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This paper describes a mathematical model of the lag phases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporates the basic concepts previously presented in a two-stage deterministic model for the growth of this organism under conditions of oxygen excess with a sugar as the growth-limiting substrate. The model structure was suggested by an extensive investigation of the causes of the lag phases of S. cerevisiae which found that, in contrast to the traditionally accepted trends, the length of the lag phase was not inoculum-size dependent. This was consistent with other previously published work which suggested that a major factor in the length of the lag phases in S. cerevisiae was the need to synthesize adequate levels of glycolytic and respiratory enzymes. These suggestions were confirmed experimentally with lag-age data. Based on this conclusion a mathematical model was developed incorporating a description of the levels of glycolytic and respiratory enzymes and their effect on the growth rate and metabolism. This model was tested experimentally and the initial results indicate indicate that many aspects of the lag phase of this organism may be described mathematically. The experimental findings further support the concept of primary regulatory control proposed by Bijkerk and Hall.},

In the present article, we develop a numerical solution scheme for the univariate, spatially inhomogeneous PBE that allows for the economical resolution of the particle size distribution at a moderate accuracy and is robust with respect to growth-dominated applications. The method combines the notion of characteristic curves in particle size space with a constrained Galerkin projection and is informed by a training step for the identification of representative shape functions. This step is based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of snapshot matrices containing adaptive grid solutions of the PBE obtained in simplified flow configurations. In order to assess the viability, accuracy and convergence properties of the combined PBE-POD approach, we analyze the pure growth and dispersion in a laminar plane jet of a polysized particle population.},

Coagulation is an important process in several environmental and engineering applications involving turbulent flow, including soot formation, gas-phase synthesis of nanoparticles and atmospheric processes, but its interaction with turbulence is not yet fully understood. Particle dynamics can be described by the PBE, whose Reynolds decomposition leads to unclosed terms involving correlations of number density fluctuations. In this work, we employ a discretisation (sectional) method for the solution of the PBE, which is free of a priori assumptions regarding the particle size distribution (PSD), and couple it with a DNS for the flow field in order to study the behaviour and significance of the unknown correlations. At present, it is not feasible to resolve the Batchelor scales that result from diffusion at high Schmidt number, hence a unity Schmidt number is employed. The investigation is conducted on a three-dimensional planar jet laden with monodisperse nanoparticles, and coagulation in the free-molecule regime is considered. The correlations due to turbulent fluctuations of the particle number density are calculated at several points in the domain and found to be positive in most cases, except close to the jet break-up. The transport equation for the moments of the PSD is also studied, and it is found that the correlations make a considerable contribution to the time-averaged coagulation source term, up to $20\,\%$ on the jet centreline and $40\,\%$ close to the edges.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and have tremendous potential as a cell source for cardiovascular regeneration. We postulate that specific vascular environmental factors will promote MSC differentiation into SMCs. However, the effects of the vascular mechanical environment on MSCs have not been characterized. Here we show that mechanical strain regulated the expression of SMC markers in MSCs. Cyclic equiaxial strain downregulated SM α-actin and SM-22α in MSCs on collagen- or elastin-coated membranes after 1 day, and decreased α-actin in stress fibers. In contrast, cyclic uniaxial strain transiently increased the expression of SM α-actin and SM-22α after 1 day, which subsequently returned to basal levels after the cells aligned in the direction perpendicular to the strain direction. In addition, uniaxial but not equiaxial strain induced a transient increase of collagen I expression. DNA microarray experiments showed that uniaxial strain increased SMC markers and regulated the expression of matrix molecules without significantly changing the expression of the differentiation markers (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and collagen II) of other cell types. Our results suggest that uniaxial strain, which better mimics the type of mechanical strain experienced by SMCs, may promote MSC differentiation into SMCs if cell orientation can be controlled. This study demonstrates the differential effects of equiaxial and uniaxial strain, advances our understanding of the mechanical regulation of stem cells, and provides a rational basis for engineering MSCs for vascular tissue engineering and regeneration. ? 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract  = {Most therapeutic applications of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs), or mesenchymal stem cells, require expansion of these cells. This study aimed to obtain more information about human MSCs regarding their expansion characteristics: growth, metabolism, and growth inhibitors. In addition, the same expansion factors were examined for (model species) goat and rat MSCs to evaluate differences between MSCs of mammalian species. MSC proliferation, nutrient consumption, and metabolite production were determined for five donors per species. In addition, the growth inhibitory concentrations of lactate and ammonia (NH3) were established. Results showed that goat MSCs grew significantly faster than human and rat MSCs and that goat cells metabolized glucose more efficiently into energy (Ylac/glc?=?0.8) than human (Ylac/glc?=?2.0) and rat MSCs (Ylac/glc?=?1.9). In addition, human (qGlc?=??9.2?pmol cell?1 day?1) and rat MSCs (qGlc?=??5.9?pmol cell?1 day?1) consumed more glucose than goat MSCs (qGlc?=??2.6?pmol cell?1 day?1). Glutamine was shown not to be important as energy source for human, goat, and rat MSCs. Regarding growth inhibition by metabolites, rat MSCs were more sensitive to lactate and NH3 (growth inhibiting at 16?mM lactate and at 1.9?mM NH3) than goat (lactate: 28.4?mM, NH3: 2.9?mM) and human MSCs (lactate: 35.4?mM, NH3: 2.4?mM). Human MSCs did not lose their differentiation potential when their growth was inhibited by lactate or NH3.},

The actual uptake and growth rates, treated as cell properties, are part of the model variables as well as the substrate concentration at the cell?liquid interface. Several regulatory loops inspired by the structure of the glycolytic chain are considered to establish a set of ordinary differential equations. The uptake rate evolves so as to reach an equilibrium between the cell demand and the environmental supply. This model does not contain any of the usual algebraic closure laws relating to the instantaneous uptake, growth rates, and the substrate concentration, nor does it enforce the continuity of mass fluxes at the liquid?cell interface. However, these relationships are found in the steady-state solution. Previously unexplained experimental observations are well reproduced by this model. Also, the model structure is suitable for further coupling with flux-based metabolic models and fluid-flow equations.},

  abstract  = {The London dispersion forces, along with the Debye and Keesom forces, constitute the long-range van der Waals forces. London's and Hamaker's work on the point-to-point dispersion interaction and Lifshitz's development of the continuum theory of dispersion are the foundations of our understanding of dispersion forces. Dispersion forces are present for all materials and are intrinsically related to the optical properties and the underlying interband electronic structures of materials. The force law scaling constant of the dispersion force, known as the Hamaker constant, can be determined from spectral or parametric optical properties of materials, combined with knowledge of the configuration of the materials. With recent access to new experimental and ab initio tools for determination of optical properties of materials, dispersion force research has new opportunities for detailed studies. Opportunities include development of improved index approximations and parametric representations of the optical properties for estimation of Hamaker constants. Expanded databases of London dispersion spectra of materials will permit accurate estimation of both nonretarded and retarded dispersion forces in complex configurations. Development of solutions for generalized multilayer configurations of materials are needed for the treatment of more-complex problems, such as graded interfaces. Dispersion forces can play a critical role in materials applications. Typically, they are a component with other forces in a force balance, and it is this balance that dictates the resulting behavior. The ubiquitous nature of the London dispersion forces makes them a factor in a wide spectrum of problems; they have been in evidence since the pioneering work of Young and Laplace on wetting, contact angles, and surface energies. Additional applications include the interparticle forces that can be measured by direct techniques, such as atomic force microscopy. London dispersion forces are important in both adhesion and in sintering, where the detailed shape at the crack tip and at the sintering neck can be controlled by the dispersion forces. Dispersion forces have an important role in the properties of numerous ceramics that contain intergranular films, and here the opportunity exists for the development of an integrated understanding of intergranular films that encompasses dispersion forces, segregation, multilayer adsorption, and structure. The intrinsic length scale at which there is a transition from the continuum perspective (dispersion forces) to the atomistic perspective (encompassing interatomic bonds) is critical in many materials problems, and the relationship of dispersion forces and intergranular films may represent an important opportunity to probe this topic. The London dispersion force is retarded at large separations, where the transit time of the electromagnetic interaction must be considered explicitly. Novel phenomena, such as equilibrium surficial films and bimodal wetting/dewetting, can result in materials systems when the characteristic wavelengths of the interatomic bonds and the physical interlayer thicknesses lead to a change in the sign of the dispersion force. Use of these novel phenomena in future materials applications provides interesting opportunities in materials design.},

  abstract = {Modelling of soot formation and oxidation of biodiesel fuels is a challenge, due to the complexity of the chemical reactions and soot formation pathways. In this paper, the discretised population balance approach and a PAH-HACA based detailed soot model have been coupled with an in-house CFD code to simulate a laminar diffusion flame with blends of different components of oxygenated biodiesel fuel, and employed to predict combustion performance and soot formation. The simulation aims to reproduce a target experiment which investigated the effects of dibutyl ether (DBE) addition to the biodiesel surrogate (methyl decanoate, MD) by increasing the mole fraction of DBE from 0 to 40%. A combined and reduced MD-DBE-PAH mechanism developed from three sub-mechanism branches has been employed in the simulation. The simulation results show that temperature rises as the DBE percentage increases to 40%. The swallow-tail shape of the soot occurrence zone and the quantity of soot production are correctly predicted. Regarding the effect of soot suppression, the model has basically captured the reducing tendency of soot formation in the measurements as the DBE addition increases from 0% to 40%. Concentrations of PAHs and C3 species contributing to the formation of aromatic rings are slightly reduced due to the addition of DBE, which is a leading cause of soot suppression. However, on the whole, the numerical solution featured much smaller differences than those observed in the experiment among laminar flames with different MD/DBE ratios, because the combined MD-DBE-PAH mechanism only present a slight difference of concentrations of soot precursor species.},

  abstract = {In this article, a coupled PBE-CFD framework has been proposed to study counterflow non-premixed flames and soot formation under an external electric field. This framework integrates the population balance equation (PBE) for nanoparticle dynamics into an in-house CFD solver for the multicomponent reactive flows. Different electric properties have been considered in this model. An ion mechanism used in both fuel-rich and fuel-lean combustion is combined with a detailed chemistry for neutral gaseous species and small-size aromatics to retain the full chemistry. In order to model soot particles carrying charges and the movement of the reacting fluid medium in the electric field, a second PBE for the production and transport of charges on soot particles is introduced for the first time and incorporated into the original PBE for the number density of particles. Also, the electric force for the gas mixture is included in the momentum equations. The electric drift velocities for ions and soot particles are also considered in the transport equations of ions and the PBE of soot particles, respectively. The simulations have shown that the presence of the electric field modifies the stagnation plane of the counterflow flames and reduces the soot formation in both rich-fuel and lean-fuel conditions in agreement with experimental observations. The application of the soot particle charging model, accompanied by a proper electric correction factor on the nanoparticle processes of nucleation and surface growth, significantly improves the stability of the flame structure. The introduction of the electric correction factor reveals that the suppression of soot formation in an electric field is mainly caused by the inhibited chemical reactions of the PAH nucleation and particle surface growth, which is more important than the electric drift of the charged particles. Reducing the critical size of the particle charging process enhances the electric drift of nascent soot, thus lessening its subsequent evolution.},

The model formulation is validated against different published experiments and it is shown that the IEM model reduces the computational costs when just the segregation of few species is of interest. A model for the maintenance costs of Escherichia coli subject to glucose concentration fluctuation is also presented and implemented in the context of the IEM mixing model. An Eulerian formulation of the effects of the substrate fluctuations on the maintenance rate is proposed and tied to a more intuitive Lagrangian vision. The study of these metabolic changes due to substrate heterogeneities helps the understanding of the relationships between hydrodynamics and cells metabolism and it improves the agreement between numerical and experimental data.},

A static model is extended by these few dynamic elements. Multiple forcing of a culture by shifting dilution rate rampwise or stepwise up-and-down and classical steady-state analysis over extended periods were the experimental methods used. It is shown that maximal respiratory capacity is not permanently available: cultures shifted from D = 0.08 h−1 to either 0.25 or 0.3 h−1 or from D = 0.22 h−1 to 0.3 h−1 do excrete ethanol and, during such transient experiments, part of the respiratory capacity is built-up de novo. There is experimental evidence that a minimal respiratory capacity is always available in yeast cultures. Ethanol has a very rapid negative effect on respiration: it suppresses the possible upper limit of respiration below the maximal value which is a characteristic property of a given strain. However, cells develop some (not investigated) mechanism to cope with the suppression which is reflected by a forgetting function that allows the upper limit to approach the maximal value. After a shift, even 3 d are not necessarily sufficient for a culture to adapt to ethanol and to come into a cellular steady state. Adaptation of a culture is an important effect which can take a very long time, namely some 100 mean residence times.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A novel mechanistic model for the growth of baker's yeast on glucoseis presented. It is based on the fact that glucose degradation proceeds via two pathways under conditions of aerobic ethanol formation. Part is metabolized oxidatively and part reductively, with ethanol being the end product of reductive energy metabolism. The corresponding metabolic state is designated oxidoreductive. Ethanol can be used oxidatively only. Maximum rates of oxidative glucose and ethanol degradation are governed by the respiratory capacity of the cells. The model is formulated by using the stoichiometric growth equations for pure oxidative and reductive (fermentative) glucose and ethanol metabolism. Together with the experimentally determinable yield coefficients (YX/S) for the respective metabolic pathways, the resulting equation system is sufficiently determined. The superiority of the presented model over hitherto published ones is based on two essential novelities. (1) The model was developed on experimentally easily accessible parameters only. (2) For the modeling of aerobic ethanol formation, the substrate flow was split into two simultaneously operating (i.e., in parallel) metabolic pathways that exhibit different but constant energy-generating efficiencies (respiration and fermentation) and consequently different and constant biomass yields (YX/S). The model allows the prediction of experimental data without parameter adaption in a biologically dubious manner.},

  abstract = {An important challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively describe microbial growth using a few measurable parameters that capture the essence of this complex phenomenon. Two key events at the cell membrane--extracellular glucose sensing and uptake--initiate the budding yeast’s growth on glucose. However, conventional growth models focus almost exclusively on glucose uptake. Here we present results from growth-rate experiments that cannot be explained by focusing on glucose uptake alone. By imposing a glucose uptake rate independent of the sensed extracellular glucose level, we show that despite increasing both the sensed glucose concentration and uptake rate, the cell’s growth rate can decrease or even approach zero. We resolve this puzzle by showing that the interaction between glucose perception and import, not their individual actions, determines the central features of growth, and characterize this interaction using a quantitative model. Disrupting this interaction by knocking out two key glucose sensors significantly changes the cell’s growth rate, yet uptake rates are unchanged. This is due to a decrease in burden that glucose perception places on the cells. Our work shows that glucose perception and import are separate and pivotal modules of yeast growth, the interaction of which can be precisely tuned and measured.},

A validated methodology for coupling the population balance equation with direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows is employed for simulating an experiment conducted by Schwarzer et al. (Chem. Engng Sci., vol. 61, no. 1, 2006, pp. 167-181), where barium sulphate nanoparticles are formed by mixing and reaction of barium chloride and sulphate acid in a T-mixer, with the spatial resolution resolved down to the Kolmogorov scale. A unity Schmidt number is assumed, since at present it is not possible to resolve the Batchelor scale for realistic Schmidt numbers (order of 1000 or more). The probability density function, filtered averages and spatial distribution of time and length scales are all examined in order to shed light on the interplay of turbulence and precipitation. Separate Damköhler numbers are defined for nucleation and growth and both are found to be close to unity, indicating that the process is neither mixing nor kinetics controlled. The nucleation length scales are also evaluated and compared with the Kolmogorov scale to show the importance of resolving nucleation bursts. In addition, zones of different rate-determining mechanisms are identified. The ultimate aim of precipitation is to obtain control over the product particle size distribution, and the present study elucidates the synergistic or competing roles of mixing, nucleation and growth on the process outcome and discusses the implications for modelling.},
