  abstract = {The introduction of composites in engineering applications led to
	a need for tools that can predict the mechanical response with account
	for the heterogeneities in the materials in order to safely design
	complex structures. These predictions are required to be sufficiently
	accurate yet computationally inexpensive, especially when dealing
	with nonlinear materials: for these the amount of internal variables
	and the computing times can both become prohibitively high. Here,
	three model order reduction homogenization methods are compared in
	detail: the potential-based Reduced Basis Model Order Reduction (pRBMOR),
	the NonUniform Transformation Field Analysis and the Mixed Transformation
	Field Analysis (MxTFA). All methods are developed in the framework
	of the Nonuniform TFA, initially introduced by Michel and Suquet.
	Two of the illustrated methods, the pRBMOR and the MxTFA, deviate
	from the TFA of Michel and Suquet in that they are based on mixed
	variational formulations. The comparison will investigate differences
	and similarities of the techniques in terms of the reduced degrees
	of freedom and their evolution law, the storage requirements and
	the accuracy of the effective constitutive behavior. Numerical tests
	on three-dimensional periodic composites under complex normal and
	shear loading paths will show the performances of the techniques.},

	discretization approach is used which treats the internal degrees
	of freedom as additional unknowns. The resulting nonlinear problem
	is formulated in a variational setting. The proposed reduced basis
	represents the behavior of the structure in a complete time interval,
	e.g. during one load cycle (for cyclic processes). The reduced variables
	are obtained by a projection of the time-local stationary conditions
	onto appropriate test functions defined in space-time. This leads
	to a low-dimensional nonlinear system of equations. Details regarding
	the theoretical derivation, the discretization and the numerical
	treatment of the nonlinearity are presented. In the numerical examples
	the reduced model is compared to FEM reference solutions. Different

Within the very narrow regime of transonic flow at some particular Mach numbers and moderate angles-of-attacks some airfoil/wing configurations experience self-sustained shock oscillations that induces large aerodynamic load variations. Such oscillations, referred to as transonic shock buffet, can reduce flight handling qualities and structural integrity, and thereby limit aircraft flight envelopes. In this study, different types of shock phenomena on OAT15A supercritical airfoil has been analyzed using Dynamic Mode Decomposition. A dominant mode pair is identified to the same frequency as the buffet frequency is responsible for the shock position and oscillation of the boundary layer. Moreover, considerable number of higher order modes are identified as an integer multiple of the buffet frequency. Furthermore, the higher order modes show comparatively thinner coherent structures at the shock travel region as the mode order goes up.},

For transport dominated phenomena often a large number of modes is needed to reproduce the solution to a given error. Here, an approach is discussed, which decomposes a flow field into several co-moving frames, where each can be approximated by a low-rank field. Special attention is given to the method of decomposition. We show that a recently introduced method can in certain cases be described as an optimum. This allows to reformulate the method as an optimization problem.},

To demonstrate this ability, a blunt body flow with quasi-steady shock motion is considered. The blunt body flow contains a strong bow shock that is moved via a change in inlet Mach number and angle of attack. Accuracy is quantified by comparing surface pressures obtained from the ROMs with those from the full order simulation under the same free stream conditions. The order reduction, and computational performance of the ROM is also quantified relative to the full order simulation. The robustness of the ROM to varying flow parameters is explored. A non-Galerkin quasi-implicit steady state implementation is considered.},
